	abstract = {Accurate definition of the similarity measure is a key component in image registration. Most commonly used intensity-based similarity measures rely on the assumptions of independence and stationarity of the intensities from pixel to pixel. Such measures cannot capture the complex interactions among the pixel intensities, and often result in less satisfactory registration performances, especially in the presence of spatially-varying intensity distortions. We propose a novel similarity measure that accounts for intensity nonstationarities and complex spatially-varying intensity distortions in mono-modal settings. We derive the similarity measure by analytically solving for the intensity correction field and its adaptive regularization. The final measure can be interpreted as one that favors a registration with minimum compression complexity of the residual image between the two registered images. One of the key advantages of the new similarity measure is its simplicity in terms of both computational complexity and implementation. This measure produces accurate registration results on both artificial and real-world problems that we have tested, and outperforms other state-of-the-art similarity measures in these cases.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is rapidly gaining acceptance as an accurate, reproducible, noninvasive method for optimal assessment of structural and functional parameters in patients with valvular heart disease. The severity of valvular regurgitation can be evaluated with cine gradient-echo MR imaging, which allows measurement of the area of the signal void corresponding to the abnormal flow jet. Alternatively, this modality can be used to obtain ventricular volumetric measurements and calculate the regurgitant fraction, or velocity-encoded cine (VEC) MR imaging can be used to quantify regurgitant blood flow. The severity of valvular stenosis can be determined by evaluating the flow jet and associated findings with either modality or by using VEC MR imaging to calculate the transvalvular pressure gradient and valve area. Dynamic MR imaging allows accurate assessment of ventricular function and comprehensive evaluation of pathophysiologic changes. In addition, good interstudy reproducibility suggests a role for VEC MR imaging in assessing the effects of therapeutic intervention and monitoring regurgitant fraction, thereby helping in surgical planning and the prevention of ventricular dysfunction. With greater cost-effectiveness and the increasing availability of new hardware and more advanced techniques, MR imaging will become a routine procedure in valvular heart disease.},

	abstract = {A system was developed for real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis and artifact correction during magnetic resonance (MR) scanning, to improve patient monitoring and triggering of MR data acquisitions. Based on the assumption that artifact production by magnetic field gradient switching represents a linear time invariant process, a noise cancellation (NC) method is applied to ECG artifact linear prediction. This linear prediction is performed using a digital finite impulse response (FIR) matrix, that is computed employing ECG and gradient waveforms recorded during a training scan. The FIR filters are used during further scanning to predict artifacts by convolution of the gradient waveforms. Subtracting the artifacts from the raw ECG signal produces the correction with minimal delay. Validation of the system was performed both off-line, using prerecorded signals, and under actual examination conditions. The method is implemented using a specially designed Signal Analyzer and Event Controller (SAEC) computer and electronics. Real-time operation was demonstrated at 1 kHz with a delay of only 1 ms introduced by the processing. The system opens the possibility of automatic monitoring algorithms for electrophysiological signals in the MR environment.},

At present, restenosis is usually detected invasively with contrast coronary angiography. This study was performed to determine if phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) could be used to detect restenosis noninvasively in patients with recurrent chest pain after percutaneous revascularization.
Methods and Results—Seventeen patients (15 men, 2 women, age 36 to 77 years) with recurrent chest pain {\textgreater}3 months after successful percutaneous intervention underwent PC-MRI measurements of coronary artery flow reserve followed by assessments of stenosis severity with computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. The intervention was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery in 15 patients, one of its diagonal branches in 2 patients, and the right coronary artery in 1 patient. A PC-MRI coronary flow reserve value ≤2.0 was 100\% and 82\% sensitive and 89\% and 100\% specific for detecting a luminal diameter narrowing of ≥70\% and ≥50\%, respectively.
Conclusions—Assessments of coronary flow reserve with PC-MRI can be used to identify flow-limiting stenoses (luminal diameter narrowings {\textgreater}70\%) in patients with recurrent chest pain in the months after a successful percutaneous intervention.},

	abstract = {Velocity and volumetric flow of left ventricular venous outflow in the distal coronary sinus were measured with magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping techniques in 24 healthy men. A total of 16-21 velocity maps were acquired throughout the cardiac cycle. To determine the accuracy of the MR velocity-mapping pulse sequence, measurements were obtained with a flow phantom. Mean blood flow was 144 mL/min +/- 62 (standard deviation); mean velocity, 2.1 cm/sec +/- 1.0; and mean cross-sectional area, 1.2 cm2. Phasic measurements revealed a biphasic flow pattern in the coronary sinus, with a first peak in systole (257 mL/min +/- 174) and a second peak in early diastole (1,090 mL/min +/- 487). The cross-sectional area varied between 0.5 cm2 +/- 0.2 at end diastole and 1.9 cm2 +/- 0.6 in systole, a finding that suggests a capacitance function for venous outflow. Mean blood flow measurements were in agreement with measurements obtained invasively in previous studies. It is concluded that MR velocity mapping can enable noninvasive measurement of coronary venous outflow and global left ventricular perfusion and may become clinically useful in assessment of coronary blood flow reserve.},

Processing of data from a large set of independent receive channels is, however, associated with an increased memory and computational load in reconstruction. This work addresses this problem by introducing coil array compression. The method allows one to reduce the number of datasets from independent channels by combining all or partial sets in the time domain prior to image reconstruction. It is demonstrated that array compression can be very effective depending on the size of the region of interest (ROI). Based on 2D in vivo data obtained with a 32-element phased-array coil in the heart, it is shown that the number of channels can be compressed to as few as four with only 0.3\% SNR loss in an ROI encompassing the heart. With twofold parallel imaging, only a 2\% loss in SNR occurred using the same compression factor. Magn Reson Med 57:1131–1139, 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Breathing-induced bulk motion of the myocardium during data acquisition may cause severe image artifacts in coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Current motion compensation strategies include breath-holding or free-breathing MR navigator gating and tracking techniques. Navigator-based techniques have been further refined by the applications of sophisticated 2D k-space reordering techniques. A further improvement in image quality and a reduction of relative scanning duration may be expected from a 3D k-space reordering scheme. Therefore, a 3D k-space reordered acquisition scheme including a 3D navigator gated and corrected segmented k-space gradient echo imaging sequence for coronary MRA was implemented. This new zonal motion-adapted acquisition and reordering technique (ZMART) was developed on the basis of a numerical simulation of the Bloch equations. The technique was implemented on a commercial 1.5T MR system, and first phantom and in vivo experiments were performed. Consistent with the results of the theoretical findings, the results obtained in the phantom studies demonstrate a significant reduction of motion artifacts when compared to conventional (non-k-space reordered) gating techniques. Preliminary in vivo findings also compare favorably with the phantom experiments and theoretical considerations. Magn Reson Med 45:645–652, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

However, it was distributed as a stand-alone application and other researchers could not extend it by writing their own custom image analysis algorithms. We believe that the work required to make a clinically applicable prototype can be reduced by making the software extensible, so that researchers can develop their own modules or improvements. Such an initiative might then serve as a bridge between image analysis research and cardiovascular research. The aim of this article is therefore to present the design and validation of a cardiovascular image analysis software package (Segment) and to announce its release in a source code format.

	abstract = {A nonrigid retrospective respiratory motion correction scheme is presented for whole-heart coronary imaging with interleaved acquisition of motion information. The quasi-periodic nature of breathing is exploited to populate a 3D nonrigid motion model from low-resolution 2D imaging slices acquired interleaved with a segmented 3D whole-heart coronary scan without imposing scan time penalty. Reconstruction and motion correction are based on inversion of a generalized encoding equation. Therein, a forward model describes the transformation from the motion free image to the motion distorted k-space data, which includes nonrigid spatial transformations. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on 10 healthy volunteers using free-breathing coronary whole-heart scans. Although conventional respiratory-gated acquisitions with 5-mm gating window resulted in an average gating efficiency of 51\% ± 11\%, nonrigid motion correction allowed for gate-free acquisitions, and hence scan time reduction by a factor of two without significant penalty in image quality. Image scores and quantitative image quality measures for the left coronary arteries showed no significant differences between 5-mm gated and gate-free acquisitions with motion correction. For the right coronary artery, slightly reduced image quality in the motion corrected gate-free scan was observed as a result of the close vicinity of anatomical structures with different motion characteristics.

The temporal resolution of the corresponding pulse sequences plays an important role concerning the potential of the method to fully detect time resolved flow or motion patterns. A further improvement of temporal or spatial resolution in phase contrast CINE MRI can be achieved by the application of view sharing. Based on simulations with point-spread-functions resulting from different cyclic flow or motion patterns an analysis of view sharing techniques in combination with phase contrast MRI is presented. Velocity mapping properties and the role of different k-space regions concerning the resulting values in the phase images and thus encoded velocities were investigated. It could be shown that the velocity induced phase shifts in phase contrast techniques are mainly encoded in the central sections of k-space which makes view sharing also suitable for velocity mapping. As a result the use of appropriate sampling and data acquisition schemes permits the assessment of flow or motion patterns with significantly improved temporal resolution without loss of functional information. In addition phantom measurements with an oscillation phantom were performed in order to validate the simulation results and to demonstrate the potential of view sharing techniques to accelerate phase contrast imaging and improve the detection of the underlying flow or motion dynamics.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is required during magnetic resonance (MR) examination for monitoring patients under anaesthesia or with heart diseases and for synchronizing image acquisition with heart activity (triggering). Accurate and fast QRS detection is therefore desirable, but this task is complicated by artefacts related to the complex MR environment (high magnetic field, radio-frequency pulses and fast switching magnetic gradients). Specific signal processing has been proposed, whether using specific MR QRS detectors or ECG denoising methods. Most state-of-the-art techniques use a connection to the MR system for achieving their task, which is a major drawback since access to the MR system is often restricted. This paper introduces a new method for on-line ECG signal enhancement, called ICARE, which takes advantage of using multi-lead ECG and does not require any connection to the MR system. It is based on independent component analysis (ICA) and applied in real time. This algorithm yields accurate QRS detection for efficient triggering.},

	abstract = {OBJECT: The objective was to improve the temporal resolution in black-blood CINE tissue phase mapping sequences at high field MR systems. The temporal resolution is limited due to SAR constraints causing idle times into the sequence. The aim was to avoid these idle times and therefore providing an increased number of heart phases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen volunteers were enrolled in this study. Each volunteer underwent different myocardial short-axis scans comprising scans with application of both presaturation pulses, with alternating application of presaturation pulses and with an attenuation of the excitation angle. The last two approaches enable a SAR reduction or increased temporal resolution. The contrast to noise ratio (CNR) between myocardium and blood and the influence on the measured tissue motion were investigated.
RESULTS: High CNR between myocardium and blood could be obtained with the application of alternating presaturation-pulses. Reduction of the flip angle of the presaturation-pulses provided reduced CNR relative to both the original and the alternated presaturation-pulses approach. More details of the myocardial motion were observed with increased temporal resolution.
CONCLUSION: It is feasible to increase the temporal resolution at high field strength by reducing the SAR with either alternating presaturation-pulses or decreased flip angle of these pulses.},

	abstract = {Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very challenging due to the perpetual heart movements. This movement is pseudo-periodic and implies several issues for image acquisition. Building a single image requires several shots, done on a specific timing of the cardiac cycle. Nowadays the heart rate is estimated before imaging and then it is assumed not to evolve during acquisition. Additionally, in order to remove motion artifacts, the patients are asked to perform breath- holds. Unfortunately, while performing a breath-hold, the heart rate is changing in a significant way. To address this problem in the framework of clinical applications, we propose a simple method to predict the out-coming RR interval, in order to compute adapted MR parameters. The RR interval is the time separating two consecutive R waves and corresponds to one cardiac cycle. Due to its simplicity this method is clinically applicable. The prediction is performed by modeling the heart rate variation as a linear combination of different sensors (here, respiratory sensor and amplitude of R wave). We evaluated this method on five healthy subjects in a clinical setup.},

This review describes the type and extent of the motion of the heart due to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, which create image artifacts. Methods of eliminating or reducing the problems caused by the cardiac cycle are discussed, including electrocardiogram gating, subject-specific acquisition windows, and section tracking. Similarly, for respiratory motion of the heart, techniques such as breath holding, respiratory gating, section tracking, phase-encoding ordering, subject-specific translational models, and a range of new techniques are considered.

Vessel cross-sectional area, through-plane velocity, and volume flow were determined in six healthy subjects. In-plane vessel displacement during the cardiac cycle, caused by cardiac contraction, was about 2-4 mm within a time frame of 32 ms in systole and early diastole. The motion resulted in blurring of images obtained during breath holding caused by the large acquisition time window (126 ms) within the cardiac cycle. Therefore, only with a high temporal resolution correct velocity images over the entire cardiac cycle could be obtained. The time- and cross-sectionally averaged velocity was 7 +/- 2 cm/s, and the volume flow was 30 +/- 10 ml/min.},

In this paper, we present a novel methodology for the assessment of LVET based the Photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform. We propose the use of Gaussian functions to model both systolic and diastolic phases of the PPG beat and consequently determine the onset and offset of the systolic ejection from the analysis of the systolic phase 3(rd) derivative. The results achieved by the proposed methodology were compared with the algorithm proposed by Chan et al.

The use of a new variable sampling in time (VAST) acquisition scheme enables the entire 3D volume to be acquired in 1.5–2 min, minimizing artifacts from bulk motion and diaphragmatic drift and contrast variations due to contrast media washout.

For all volunteers, characteristic myocardial motion patterns, such as triphasic global diastolic expansion, could be detected with high accuracy. One volunteer underwent an additional echocardiographic measurement in order to corroborate the complex motion features as measured by MRI. Patient examinations revealed substantial changes in diastolic function compared to motion patterns in healthy volunteers.ConclusionThe proposed high-temporal-resolution velocity-mapping technique provides previously undetectable information on LV performance, and is highly promising for the detection of local and global motion abnormalities in patients with disturbed LV performance, such as diastolic dysfunction.

	abstract = {The signal intensity of balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) imaging is a function of the proton density, T1, T2, flip angle (α), and repetition time (TR). The steady-state signal intensity that is established after about 5*T1/TR can be described analytically. The transient phase or the approach of the echo amplitudes to the steady state is an exponential decay from the initial amplitude after the first excitation pulse to the steady-state signal. An analytical expression of the decay rate of this transient phase is presented that is based on a simple analysis derived from the Bloch equations. The decay rate is a weighted average of the T1 and T2 relaxation times, where the weighting is determined by the flip angle of the excitation pulses. Thus, balanced SSFP imaging during the transient phase can provide various contrasts depending on the flip angle and the number of excitation pulses applied before the acquisition of the central k-space line. In addition, transient imaging of hyperpolarized nuclei, such as 3He, 129Xe, or 13C, can be optimized according to their T1 and T2 relaxation times.

	abstract = {New, efficient reconstruction procedures are proposed for sensitivity encoding (SENSE) with arbitrary k-space trajectories. The presented methods combine gridding principles with so-called conjugate-gradient iteration. In this fashion, the bulk of the work of reconstruction can be performed by fast Fourier transform (FFT), reducing the complexity of data processing to the same order of magnitude as in conventional gridding reconstruction. Using the proposed method, SENSE becomes practical with nonstandard k-space trajectories, enabling considerable scan time reduction with respect to mere gradient encoding. This is illustrated by imaging simulations with spiral, radial, and random k-space patterns. Simulations were also used for investigating the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm and its dependence on the factor by which gradient encoding is reduced. The in vivo feasibility of non-Cartesian SENSE imaging with iterative reconstruction is demonstrated by examples of brain and cardiac imaging using spiral trajectories. In brain imaging with six receiver coils, the number of spiral interleaves was reduced by factors ranging from 2 to 6. In cardiac real-time imaging with four coils, spiral SENSE permitted reducing the scan time per image from 112 ms to 56 ms, thus doubling the frame-rate.

	abstract = {Existing functional brain MR imaging methods detect neuronal activity only indirectly via a surrogate signal such as deoxyhemoglobin concentration in the vascular bed of cerebral parenchyma. It has been recently proposed that neuronal currents may be measurable directly using MRI (ncMRI). However, limited success has been reported in neuronal current detection studies that used standard gradient or spin echo pulse sequences. The balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) pulse sequence is unique in that it can afford the highest known SNR efficiency and is exquisitely sensitive to perturbations in free precession phase. It is reported herein that when a spin phase-perturbing periodic current is locked to an RF pulse train, phase perturbations are accumulated across multiple RF excitations and the spin magnetization reaches an alternating balanced steady state (ABSS) that effectively amplifies the phase perturbations due to the current. The alternation of the ABSS signal therefore is highly sensitive to weak periodic currents. Current phantom experiments employing ABSS imaging resulted in detection of magnetic field variations as small as 0.15nT in scans lasting for 36 sec, which is more sensitive than using gradient-recalled echo imaging.

The optimal combination and weighting of the navigators is determined on the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA). Thus, based on a given navigator measurement the current motion state of the object can be predicted by means of the calibrated motion model. The 3D motion model is applied in high-resolution coronary MR angiography examinations (CMRA) to prospectively correct for respiration-induced motion. The basic feasibility of the proposed calibration procedure was shown in 16 volunteers. Furthermore, the application of the calibrated motion model for CMRA examinations of the right coronary artery (RCA) was tested in 10 volunteers.

	abstract = {A model-based dynamic MRI called k-t BLAST/SENSE has drawn significant attention from the MR imaging community because of its improved spatio-temporal resolution. Recently, we showed that the k-t BLAST/SENSE corresponds to the special case of a new dynamic MRI algorithm called k-t FOCUSS that is optimal from a compressed sensing perspective. The main contribution of this article is an extension of k-t FOCUSS to a more general framework with prediction and residual encoding, where the prediction provides an initial estimate and the residual encoding takes care of the remaining residual signals. Two prediction methods, RIGR and motion estimation/compensation scheme, are proposed, which significantly sparsify the residual signals. Then, using a more sophisticated random sampling pattern and optimized temporal transform, the residual signal can be effectively estimated from a very small number of k-t samples. Experimental results show that excellent reconstruction can be achieved even from severely limited k-t samples without aliasing artifacts. Magn Reson Med 61:103–116, 2009. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {A novel balanced SSFP technique for the separation or suppression of different resonance frequencies (e.g., fat suppression) is presented. The method is based on applying two alternating and different repetition times, TR(1) and TR(2). This RF scheme manipulates the sensitivity of balanced SSFP to off-resonance effects by a modification of the frequency response profile. Starting from a general approach, an optimally broadened stopband within the frequency response function is designed. This is achieved with a TR(2) being one third of TR(1) and an RF-pulse phase increment of 90 degrees . With this approach TR(2) is too short ( approximately 1 ms) to switch imaging gradients and is only used to change the frequency sensitivity. Without a significant change of the spectral position of the stopband, TR(1) can be varied over a range of values ( approximately 2.5-4.5 ms) while TR(2) and phase cycling is kept constant. On-resonance spins show a magnetization behavior similar to balanced SSFP, but with maximal magnetization at flip angles about 10 degrees lower than in balanced SSFP. The total scan time is increased by about 30\% compared to conventional balanced SSFP. The new technique was applied on phantoms and volunteers to produce rapid, fat suppressed images.},

This is challenging to do accurately and fast due to the large dynamic range of B(1) (+) and tight SAR constraints. In the present work, this problem is revisited and solved by a novel mapping approach relying on an interference principle. The B(1) (+) fields of individual transmitter elements are measured indirectly by observing their interference with a SAR-efficient baseline RF field. In this fashion even small RF fields can be observed in the B(1) (+) -sensitive large-flip-angle regime. Based on a set of such experiments B(1) (+) maps of the individual transmitter channels are obtained by solving a linear inverse problem. Confounding relaxation and off-resonance effects are addressed by an extended signal model and nonlinear fitting. Using the novel approach, 2D mapping of an 8-channel transmitter array was accomplished in less than a minute. For validation it is demonstrated that mapping results do not vary with T(1) or parameters of the mapping sequence. In RF shimming experiments it is shown that the measured B(1) (+) maps accurately reflect the linearity of RF superposition.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of sensitivity encoding on the quantitative assessment of cardiac motion in black blood cine tissue phase mapping (TPM) sequences. Up to now whole volume coverage of the heart is still limited by the long acquisition times. Therefore, a significant increase in imaging speed without deterioration of quantitative motion information is indispensable.


METHODS

20 volunteers were enrolled in this study. Each volunteer underwent myocardial short-axis TPM scans with different SENSE acceleration factors. The influence of SENSE acceleration on the measured motion curves was investigated.


RESULTS

It is demonstrated that all TPM sequences with SENSE acceleration have only minimum influence on the motion curves. Even with a SENSE factor of four, the decrease in the amplitude of the motion curve was less than 3\%. No significant difference was observed for the global correlation coefficient and deviation between the motion curves obtained by the reproducibility and the SENSE accelerated measurements.


CONCLUSIONS

It is feasible to accelerate myocardial TPM measurements with SENSE factors up to 4 without losing substantial information of the motion pattern.},

L'environnement IRM, de par ses trois composantes physiques caractéristiques, perturbe les signaux ECG. Les gradients de champ magnétique compliquent notamment grandement l'analyse de l'ECG de manière non conventionnelle. Le développement de traitements spécifiques est donc nécessaire, les méthodes existantes de détection QRS et de débruitage ne répondant pas de manière satisfaisante à ce problème. Une base de données ECG en IRM a été réalisée, afin de permettre le développement de nouvelles méthodes et leur évaluation selon deux critères : la qualité de détection des battements cardiaques et une estimation du rapport signal sur bruit spécifique à ces enregistrements. Un détecteur QRS capable de traiter ces signaux fortement bruités a été proposé. Cette technique est basée sur la détection et la caractérisation des singularités à partir des lignes de maxima d'ondelettes. Ce détecteur apporte une information sur le rythme cardiaque, primordiale pour la mise en place de nouvelles approches statistiques. Une méthode de débruitage basée sur l'analyse en composantes indépendantes a été présentée. Celle-ci utilise uniquement les signaux ECG. Une approche bayésienne de débruitage, reposant sur une unification de deux modèles (d'ECG et des artefacts de gradient), a été proposée.

Phantom studies were designed to evaluate the accuracy of MR phase velocity mapping (MRV) with PEG in continuous and pulsatile flow measurements in small vessels. Experiments were performed on a 1.5‐T MRI system and results were compared with those obtained by timed volume measurements and a transit‐time ultrasound flowmeter. Flow velocity, pulsatile flow wave form, pulsing rate, and PEG size were varied. For continuous flow, MRV measured velocities correlated well with those calculated from timed volume measurements (r{\textgreater}0.998) under mean spatial velocities ranging from 20–100 cm s−1. The temporal mean velocity difference between MRV and ultrasound flowmeter measurements was less than ±2.9 cm s−1 under pulsatile flow conditions with PEG sizes of 5 or less, however, the mean velocity difference was {\textgreater}7 cm s−1 for PEG sizes of 8 or more. Accurate MR velocity measurement with PEG in small vessels under conditions of pulsatile flow is possible if an appropriate PEG size is selected.},

	abstract = {Black Blood Fast Spin Echo imaging of the heart is usually performed during mid-diastolic rest. This is a direct consequence of the long inversion time required to suppress the blood signal, which is constrained by the T1 of the blood, and of the heart rate. To overcome these constraints, and to acquire black blood images in the end-systolic rest period, a new approach is introduced aiming at adaptively predicting the best time to prepare and acquire MR signals. It is based on a RR interval prediction algorithm and on a cardiac cycle model. The proposed method was applied to 14 healthy volunteers and is compared to a simple alternative method using a fixed delay and to the standard black blood imaging method for imaging in the mid-diastolic rest period. Results show that the proposed method offers an increased robustness in terms of trigger delay error and image quality compared to the tested simple alternative. Also, it has been shown by qualitative analysis done by an experienced observer that the right ventricle, especially the thin right ventricle free wall, is better depicted with our method than with the standard mid-diastolic rest acquisition.

The purpose of our study was to quantify left ventricular function and mass derived from retrospectively ECG-gated 16-MDCT coronary angiography data sets using a new analysis software based on automatic contour detection in comparison to corresponding standard of reference measurements acquired with MRI.SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Multiplanar reformations in the short-axis orientation were calculated from axial contrast-enhanced CT images in 18 patients (men, 15; women, three; age range, 38–70 years; mean, 57.4 ± 10.2 [SD] years) who were referred for CT coronary angiography. End-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), and left ventricular mass (LVM) were analyzed with a recently developed imaging software using an automated contour detection algorithm of left ventricular endo- and epicardial contours and by manual tracing. The data were compared with similar measurements on MRI as the standard of reference.RESULTS. EDV, ESV, EF, and LVM derived from an automated contour detection algorithm were not statistically significantly different from manual tracing (CTauto vs CTmanual: EDV = 137.1 ± 45.7 mL vs 134.2 ± 39.9 mL, ESV = 58.8 ± 34.2 mL vs 58.1 ± 30.1 mL, EF = 59.2\% ± 13.7\% vs 58.1\% ± 12.0\%, LVM = 130.9 ± 29.1 g vs 133.7 ± 33.2 g; p {\textgreater} 0.05). However, EDV (118.7 ± 43.6 mL), ESV (50.1 ± 33.5 mL), and LVM (142.8 ± 38.4 g) as calculated on MR data sets were statistically significantly different from those calculated on CT (p {\textless} 0.05), whereas MRI-based EF (59.9\% ± 14.4\%) did not differ statistically significantly from those based on both CT algorithms (p {\textgreater} 0.05).CONCLUSION. Automatic and manual analysis of data acquired during CT coronary angiography using a 16-MDCT scanner allows a reliable assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction and a rough estimation of left ventricular volumes and mass.},

In this study, a high temporal resolution PC technique which retains both the spatial resolution and breath-hold length of conventional magnitude imaging is presented. Improvement by a factor of 2 in the temporal resolution was achieved by acquiring the differentially flow-encoded images in separate breath-holds rather than interleaved within a single breath-hold. Additionally, a multiecho readout was incorporated into the PC experiment to acquire more views per unit time than is possible with the single gradient-echo technique. A total improvement in temporal resolution by ∼5 times over conventional PC imaging was achieved. A complete set of images containing velocity data in all three directions was acquired in four breath-holds, with a temporal resolution of 11.2 ms and an in-plane spatial resolution of 2 mm × 2 mm.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7786838},
	abstract = {An understanding of the role of the aortic elastic properties indicates their relevance at several sites of cardiovascular function. Acting as an elastic buffering chamber behind the heart (the Windkessel function), the aorta and some of the proximal large vessels store about 50\% of the left ventricular stroke volume during systole. In diastole, the elastic forces of the aortic wall forward this 50\% of the volume to the peripheral circulation, thus creating a nearly continuous peripheral blood flow. This systolic-diastolic interplay represents the Windkessel function, which has an influence not only on the peripheral circulation but also on the heart, resulting in a reduction of left ventricular afterload and improvement in coronary blood flow and left ventricular relaxation. The elastic resistance (or stiffness), which the aorta sets against its systolic distention, increases with aging, with an increase in blood pressure, and with pathological changes such as atherosclerosis. This increased stiffness leads to an increase in systolic blood pressure and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure at any given mean pressure, an increase in systolic blood velocity, an increase in left ventricular afterload, and a decrease in subendocardial blood supply during diastole, and must be considered a major pathophysiological factor, for example, in systolic hypertension. The elastic properties of the aortic Windkessel can be assessed in vivo in humans in several ways, most easily by measuring the pulse wave velocity along the aorta. The higher this velocity, the higher the elastic resistance, that is, the stiffness. Other methods depend on assessment of the ratio between pulse pressure and aortic volume changes (delata P/delta V), which can be assessed noninvasively by ultrasonic or tomographic methods. All assessments of vessel stiffness have to take into account the direct effect of current blood pressure, and thus judgements about influences of interventions rely on an unchanged blood pressure. Alternatively, to derive the "intrinsic" stiffness of the aortic wall one has to correct for the effect of the blood pressure present. Recently reports about pharmacologic influences on the elastic properties of the aorta have emerged in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

As phase is defined in the (−π,π] range, however, phase wraps often occur, which complicates image analysis and interpretation. This work presents a two-dimensional phase unwrapping algorithm that uses quality-guided region growing and local linear estimation. The quality map employs the variance of the second-order partial derivatives of the phase as the quality criterion. Phase information from unwrapped neighboring pixels is used to predict the correct phase of the current pixel using a linear regression method. The algorithm was tested on both simulated and real data, and is shown to successfully unwrap phase images that are corrupted by noise and have rapidly changing phase.

Given its versatility and wide range of quantitative parameters, however, agreement on specific standards for the interpretation and post-processing of CMR studies is required to ensure consistent quality and reproducibility of CMR reports. This document addresses this need by providing consensus recommendations developed by the Task Force for Post Processing of the Society for Cardiovascular MR (SCMR). The aim of the task force is to recommend requirements and standards for image interpretation and post processing enabling qualitative and quantitative evaluation of CMR images. Furthermore, pitfalls of CMR image analysis are discussed where appropriate.},

Yet MRI systems research is trending to higher channel count receivers, transmitters, gradient/shims, and unique interfaces for interventional applications. Customized console designs are now feasible for researchers with modern electronic components, but high data rates, synchronization, scalability, and cost present important challenges. Implementing large multi-channel MR systems with efficiency and flexibility requires a scalable modular architecture. With Medusa, we propose an open system architecture using the Universal Serial Bus (USB) for scalability, combined with distributed processing and buffering to address the high data rates and strict synchronization required by multi-channel MRI. Medusa uses a modular design concept based on digital synthesizer, receiver, and gradient blocks, in conjunction with fast programmable logic for sampling and synchronization. Medusa is a form of synthetic instrument, being reconfigurable for a variety of medical/scientific instrumentation needs. The Medusa distributed architecture, scalability, and data bandwidth limits are presented, and its flexibility is demonstrated in a variety of novel MRI applications.},

	abstract = {A simple, reproducible, noninvasive Doppler index for the assessment of overall cardiac function has been described previously. The purpose of this study was to correlate the Doppler index with accepted indexes of cardiac catheterization of left ventricular performance. Thirty-four patients with ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy prospectively underwent a simultaneous cardiac catheterization and Doppler echocardiographic study. Invasive measurements of peak +dP/dt, peak -dP/dt, and tau were obtained from the high-fidelity left ventricular pressures. A Doppler index of myocardial performance was defined as the summation of isovolumetric contraction and relaxation time divided by ejection time. There was a correlation between Doppler measurement of isovolumetric contraction time and peak +dP/dt (r = 0.842; p \&lt; 0.0001) and Doppler measurement of isovolumetric relaxation time and peak -dP/dt (r = 0.638; p \&lt; 0.001). Left ventricular ejection time correlated with both peak +dP/dt (r = 0.539; p \&lt;0.001) and peak -dP/dt (r = 0.582; p \&lt; 0.001). The Doppler index correlated with simultaneously recorded systolic peak +dP/dt (r = 0.821; p \&lt; 0.0001) and diastolic peak -dP/dt (r = 0.833; p \&lt; 0.001) and tau (r = 0.680; p \&lt; 0.0001). This study documents that a simple, easily recordable, noninvasive Doppler index of myocardial performance correlates with invasive measurement of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and appears to be a promising noninvasive measurement of overall cardiac function.

One of their major drawbacks is their sensitivity to off-resonance effects arising from Bo inhomogeneities, which can produce the familiar dark bands in the images. Radio frequency (RF) phase cycling is known to minimize this artifact. Although RF phase-cycled bSSFP is an accepted and firmly established technique, a simple and intuitive analytical signal equation has not yet been provided. Here, a complete theoretical framework is developed from which insightful characterizations such as signal uniformity, optimal flip angle, SNR efficiency, and banding effect minimization are provided. The analytical predictions and guidelines are substantiated via direct numerical simulations for clinically relevant tissues (e.g., water-like organs and lipids) using various acquisition conditions, and also verified experimentally with phantoms. We demonstrate that the banding artifact can be virtually eliminated, even for phantoms immersed in significantly nonuniform magnetic fields. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These changes varied between individuals, but reduction in systolic intervals was consistently less than that reported from populations showing a range of resting heart rates. Individual regression formulae relating each variable to paced heart rate were used to calculate rate-dependent and rate-independent changes induced by isoprenaline and ouabain. Despite technical difficulty in precise measurement of systolic intervals, there was an excellent inverse correlation between rate-independent changes in Q-S2 and in both dP/dt(mac) and (dP/dt)/CPIP. Rate-independent change in Q-S2 appears to be a practical, moderately sensitive, and reasonably precise measure of the inotropic effect of a drug which does not radically alter left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or blood pressure. Day-to-day variation in systolic intervals may limit the use of the technique to studies of short duration.},

It is based on undersampling in k-space and utilizes the fact that the dynamics of an evolving process are often confined to a local area within the full FOV. In the work presented here the reduced FOV approach is applied to projection-reconstruction MRI and compared to the original spin-warp implementation. Results are presented that clearly demonstrate the increased robustness of the projection-reconstruction version of rFOV imaging. The technique is successfully applied to an MR-guided biopsy scenario (ex-vivo) and to cine cardiac imaging. Finally an algorithm is proposed that uses the intrinsic advantages of radial k-space sampling to evaluate the projection data to control the adjustment of position and size of the reduced FOV window.},

In order for CS-based imaging schemes to be effective, the signal of interest should be sparse or compressible in a known representation, and the measurement scheme should have good mathematical properties with respect to this representation. While MR images are often compressible, the second requirement is often only weakly satisfied with respect to commonly used Fourier encoding schemes. This paper investigates the use of random encoding for CS-MRI, in an effort to emulate the \#x201C;universal \#x201D; encoding schemes suggested by the theoretical CS literature. This random encoding is achieved experimentally with tailored spatially-selective radio-frequency (RF) pulses. Both simulation and experimental studies were conducted to investigate the imaging properties of this new scheme with respect to Fourier schemes. Results indicate that random encoding has the potential to outperform conventional encoding in certain scenarios. However, our study also indicates that random encoding fails to satisfy theoretical sufficient conditions for stable and accurate CS reconstruction in many scenarios of interest. Therefore, there is still no general theoretical performance guarantee for CS-MRI, with or without random encoding, and CS-based methods should be developed and validated carefully in the context of specific applications.},

A segmented, gradient-recalled-echo sequence (FASTCARD) was modified to acquire data continuously. Images were reconstructed retrospectively by selecting views from each heartbeat based on cardiac phase rather than the time elapsed from the QRS complex. Cardiac phase was calculated using a model that compensates for beat-to-beat heart rate changes. Images collected using cardiac phase to order reconstruction (CAPTOR) depict the entire cardiac cycle and lack the temporal gap that is characteristic of prospectively reconstructed sequences. Time-volume curves of the left ventricle capture the contribution of atrial contraction to end-diastolic volume (EDV). Transmitral phase-contrast flow measurements show a second peak inflow (a wave) that is absent in the standard sequence. Because atrial contraction contributes to ventricular EDV, images using CAPTOR potentially may provide a more reliable measure of EDV, stroke volume, and ejection fraction than standard techniques.},

Pulsed tissue Doppler imaging may be useful for evaluating the effect of aging on diastolic LV function in healthy persons. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 1999;12:574-81.)},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using MRI-controlled focused ultrasound (FUS) and thermosensitive liposomes to achieve thermally mediated localised drug delivery in vivo. Materials and methods: Results are reported from ten rabbits, where a FUS beam was scanned in a circular trajectory to heat 10-15 mm diameter regions in normal thigh to 43°C for 20-30 min. MRI thermometry was used for closed-loop feedback control to achieve temporally and spatially uniform heating. Lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin was infused intravenously during hyperthermia. Unabsorbed liposomes were flushed from the vasculature by saline perfusion 2 h later, and tissue samples were harvested from heated and unheated thigh regions. The fluorescence intensity of the homogenised samples was used to calculate the concentration of doxorubicin in tissue. Results: Closed-loop control of FUS heating using MRI thermometry achieved temperature distributions with mean, T90 and T10 of 42.9°C, 41.0°C and 44.8°C, respectively, over a period of 20 min. Doxorubicin concentrations were significantly higher in tissues sampled from heated than unheated regions of normal thigh muscle (8.3 versus 0.5 ng/mg, mean per-animal difference = 7.8 ng/mg, P {\textless} 0.05, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test). Conclusions: The results show the potential of MRI-controlled focused ultrasound hyperthermia for enhanced local drug delivery with temperature-sensitive drug carriers.},

Established methods correct motion between successive repetitions based on the acquired imaging volumes either retrospectively or prospectively. A fast, highly accurate, and prospective real-time correction method for fMRI using external optical motion tracking has been implemented. The head position is determined by means of an optical stereoscopic tracking system. The method corrects motion during the acquisition of an fMRI time series on a slice-by-slice basis by continuously updating the imaging volume position to follow the motion of the head. This method allows the measurement of fMRI data in the presence of significant motion during the acquisition of a single volume. Even without intentional motion, fMRI signal stability is maintained and higher sensitivity to detect activation is achieved without reducing specificity. With significant motion, only the proposed approach allowed detection of brain activation. The results show that the new method is superior to image-based correction methods, which fail in the case of fast or excessive motion.},

With this method, a complete set of preliminary data is acquired along with information about the relative motion position of each frame of data. After all the preliminary data are acquired, the position information is used to determine which data frames are most corrupted by motion. Frames of data are then reacquired, starting with the most corrupted one. The position information is continually updated in an iterative process; therefore, each subsequent reacquisition is always done on the worst frame of data.

	abstract = {Atherosclerotic plaque rupture leading to stroke is the major cause of long-term disability as well as the third most common cause of mortality. Image-based computational models have been introduced seeking critical mechanical indicators, which may be used for plaque vulnerability assessment. This study extends the previous 2D critical stress concept to 3D by using in vivo magnetic resonance image (MRI) data of human atherosclerotic carotid plaques and 3D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models to: identify 3D critical plaque wall stress (CPWS) and critical flow shear stress (CFSS) and to investigate their associations with plaque rupture. In vivo MRI data of carotid plaques from 18 patients scheduled for endarterectomy were acquired using histologically validated multicontrast protocols. Of the 18 plaques, histology-confirmed that six had prior rupture (group 1) as evidenced by presence of ulceration. The remaining 12 plaques (group 2) contained no rupture. The 3D multicomponent FSI models were constructed for each plaque to obtain 3D plaque wall stress (PWS) and flow shear stress (FSS) distributions. Three-dimensional CPWS and CFSS, defined as maxima of PWS and FSS from all vulnerable sites, were determined for each plaque to investigate their association with plaque rupture. Slice-based critical PWS and FSS were also calculated for all slices for more detailed analysis and comparison. The mean 3D CPWS of group 1 was 263.44 kPa, which was 100\% higher than that from group 2 (132.77, p=0.03984). Five of the six ruptured plaques had 3D CPWS sites, matching the histology-confirmed rupture sites with an 83\% agreement. Although the mean 3D CFSS (92.94 dyn/cm(2)) for group 1 was 76\% higher than that for group 2 (52.70 dyn/cm(2)), slice-based CFSS showed no significant difference between the two groups. Only two of the six ruptured plaques had 3D CFSS sites matching the histology-confirmed rupture sites with a 33\% agreement. CFSS had a good correlation with plaque stenosis severity (R(2)=0.40 with an exponential function fitting 3D CFSS data). This in vivo MRI pilot study using plaques with and without rupture demonstrates that 3D critical plaque wall stress values are more closely associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture then critical flow shear stresses. Critical wall stress values may become indicators of high risk sites of rupture. Future work with a larger population will establish a possible CPWS-based plaque vulnerability classification.},

Unlike other MRI applications, high-resolution coronary MRA has not been amenable to acceleration by parallel imaging techniques due to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) concerns. In the present work, mitigating SNR limitations by the transition to higher static magnetic field strength is proposed, thus enabling scan time reduction by the parallel sensitivity encoding (SENSE) technique. The study reports the implementation and evaluation of free-breathing navigator-gated 3D coronary MRA with SENSE at 3T. Results from 11 healthy subjects indicate that the approach permits significant scan time reduction in MRA of the left and right coronary systems. Quantitative image analysis and visual grading suggest that two-fold scan acceleration can be accomplished at nearly preserved image quality. The additional experiments appear to demonstrate that parallel MRA equally permits enhancing volume coverage and spatial resolution while maintaining scan time.

Comparison between the 20-channel mouse array and a length-matched quadrature driven small animal birdcage coil showed an SNR increase at the periphery and in the center of the phantom of 3- and 1.3-fold, respectively. Comparison with a shorter but SNR-optimized birdcage coil (aspect ratio 1:1 and only half mouse coverage) showed an SNR gain of twofold at the edge of the phantom and similar SNR in the center.

	abstract = {Conventional magnetic resonance images have uniform spatial resolution across the entire field of view. A method of creating MR images with user-specified spatial resolution along one dimension of the field of view was described recently by the authors. This paper presents the 2D generalization of this technique, which allows the user to specify arbitrary spatial resolution in arbitrary 2D regions. These images are reconstructed from signals that sparsely sample the k-space representation of the image. Therefore, locally focused images can be acquired in less time than that required by Fourier imaging with uniformly high resolution. In this paper the authors show how to increase the temporal resolution of dynamic imaging (e.g., interventional imaging) by using high resolution in areas of expected change and lower resolution elsewhere. Alternatively, by matching the local spatial resolution to the expected edge content of the image, it is possible to avoid the localized truncation artifacts that mark Fourier images reconstructed from the same number of signals. For example, the authors show how proton spectroscopic images of the head may be improved by using high resolution in the neighborhood of scalp lipids that might otherwise cause truncation artifacts.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To improve the accuracy of ventricular volume estimates and effective temporal resolution in fast cardiac acquisitions.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data sets at intermediate temporal phases were generated by means of sharing of views from two temporally adjacent data sets. A simulated model was used, and studies with patients and volunteers were conducted. View sharing was implemented in both fast gradient-echo and fast phase-contrast cine acquisitions; breath holding was used when possible.


RESULTS

Uniform repetition time (TR) radio-frequency (RF) excitation allowed a better assessment of the end-diastolic ventricular volume. In addition, view sharing provided a better estimate of end-systolic ventricular volume in cases in which rapid changes in volume occurred at or about the temporal boundary of the source images. View sharing also provided a much smoother representation of dynamic cardiac motion when viewed in a cine loop.


CONCLUSION

View sharing and uniform TR RF excitation improve the accuracy of end-systolic and end-diastolic ventricular volume measurements by improving the effective temporal resolution.},

This study was designed to assess whether mitral annular velocities as assessed by tissue Doppler imaging are associated with invasive measures of diastolic LV performance and whether additional information is gained over traditional Doppler variables.
Methods and Results—One hundred consecutive patients referred for cardiac catheterization underwent simultaneous Doppler interrogation. Invasive measurements of LV pressures were obtained with micromanometer-tipped catheters, and the mean LV diastolic pressure (M-LVDP) was used as a surrogate for mean left atrial pressure. Doppler signals from the mitral inflow, pulmonary venous inflow, and TDI of the mitral annulus were obtained. Isolated parameters of transmitral flow correlated with M-LVDP only when ejection fraction {\textless}50\%. The ratio of mitral velocity to early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (E/E′) showed a better correlation with M-LVDP than did other Doppler variables for all levels of systolic function. E/E′ {\textless}8 accurately predicted normal M-LVDP, and E/E′ {\textgreater}15 identified increased M-LVDP. Wide variability was present in those with E/E′ of 8 to 15. A subset of those patients with E/E′ 8 to 15 could be further defined by use of other Doppler data.
Conclusions—The combination of tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus and mitral inflow velocity curves provides better estimates of LV filling pressures than other methods (pulmonary vein, preload reduction). However, accurate prediction of filling pressures for an individual patient requires a stepwise approach incorporating all available data.},

The motion of the heart due to respiration is approximately a global translation.

	abstract = {Purpose	A cardiac model is required either to predict a cardiac time period in which triggered data can be acquired with minimal motion, or to associate acquired k-space lines with cardiac phases in retrospective reconstruction of cine acquisitions. The usual timing model is based on the prediction of systole durations from the heart rate. It was calibrated on a population yielding fixed parameters and cannot account for individual variability. To improve high resolution MRI, we propose a personalized model that better predicts systole.
Methods	A phase contrast sequence was modified to acquire only central k-space line with 6.6 ms temporal resolution. Blood velocity was measured in aorta during 128 heartbeats in 35 subjects. Segmentation of aorta and detection of end of forward systolic ejection was automatic. Duration of electromechanical systole as function of heart rate was determined for each subject separately.
Results		The adapted cardiac model predicted significantly better both MRI end-systolic times and echocardiographic reference measurements (6.7 ms average absolute error, close to temporal resolution of acquisition) compared to global model (16.4 ms average absolute error). Favourable impact on cine reconstruction was shown.
Conclusion	Personalization of cardiac model to the subject is feasible in MRI and reduces the error of prediction of systole.},

MR flow quantitation is performed with a gradientecho MR sequence with high temporal resolution enabling measurements at frequent intervals throughout the cardiac cycle. MR flow quantitation uses the phase rather than the amplitude of the MR signal to reconstruct the images. These images, often referred to as MR velocity maps or velocity-encoded cine MR images, are two-dimensional displays of flow velocity. From these velocity maps, velocity and volume flow data can be obtained. Previous validation experiments have demonstrated the accuracy of MR velocity mapping, and this technique is now being applied successfully in several clinical fields. MR velocity mapping may be of considerable value when Doppler echocardiography results are unsatisfactory or equivocal, particularly because MR is suited for the analysis of volumetric flow and complex flow patterns. Among the vastly growing number of clinical cardiovascular applications that have been reported are the great arteries and veins, coronary vessels, valvular disease, and the abdominal and peripheral vessels. These items are reviewed, and some aspects of the technique that need improvement are discussed.},

First results in a study with 12 healthy volunteers gave highly consistent values for the radial (expansion/compression) as well as the rotational velocities. Except for one volunteer, motion at the R wave of the ECG starts with clockwise rotation, followed by contraction and expansion accompanied by counterclockwise rotation.

	abstract = {The temporal and spatial resolution of real-time phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) is restricted by the need to acquire two interleaved phase images. In this article, we propose a split-acquisition real-time CINE PCMR technique, where the acquisition of flow-encoded and flow-compensated data is divided into separate blocks. By comparing magnitude images, automatic matching of data in cardio-respiratory space allows subtraction of background phase offsets. Thus, the data is acquired in real-time but with phase correction originating from a different heart beat. This effectively doubles the frame rate, allowing either higher temporal or spatial resolution. Two split-acquisition sequences were tested: one with high-temporal resolution and one with high-spatial resolution. Both sequences showed excellent agreement in stroke volumes in 20 adults when validated against cardiac-gated PCMR and interleaved real-time PCMR (cardiac gated: 95.2 ± 20.0 mL, interleaved real-time: 96.2 ± 20.7 mL, high-temporal resolution: 95.6 ± 20.1 mL, high-spatial resolution: 95.5 ± 20.4 mL). In six children, the high-spatial resolution sequence provided more accurate flow measurements than interleaved real-time PCMR, when compared with cardiac-gated PCMR (cardiac gated: 20.6 ± 7.6 mL, interleaved real-time: 24.3 ± 9.2 mL, high-spatial resolution: 20.8 ± 7.8 mL), due to the increased spatial resolution. The matching technique is shown to be accurate (truth: 94.6 ± 21.8, split-acquisition: 95.0 ± 21.9 mL) and quantitative image quality (signal-to-noise ratio, velocity-to-noise ratio and edge sharpness) is acceptable.},

	abstract = {Phase contrast velocity imaging is a standard method for accurate in vivo flow measurement. One drawback, however, is that it lengthens the scan time (or reduces the achievable temporal resolution) because one has to acquire two or more images with different flow sensitivities and subtract their phases to produce the final velocity image. Without this step, non-flow-related phase variations will give rise to an erroneous, spatially varying background velocity. In this paper, we introduce a novel phase contrast velocity imaging technique that requires the acquisition of only a single image. The idea is to estimate the background phase variation from the flow-encoded image itself and then have it removed, leaving only the flow-related phase to generate a corrected flow image. This technique is sensitive to flow in one direction and requires 50\% less scan time than conventional phase contrast velocity imaging. Phantom and in vivo results were obtained and compared with those of the conventional method, demonstrating the new method's effectiveness in measuring flow in various vessels of the body.

Temporal resolution of the acquired images is improved by the use of high-speed gradients and application of view sharing to black blood k-space segmented gradient echo imaging.

Simulations showed that correlation analysis can be used to differentiate regions with altered velocity waveforms from global radial velocities. Results of patient examinations are presented on an exemplary basis and demonstrate that correlation analysis provides an effective method for identification and classification of myocardial dynamics.ConclusionWithin the framework of our volunteer and patient examinations, fast phase contrast cardiac MRI has proven to be a reliable method to assess and analyze myocardial performance on the basis of two-directional velocity vector fields.

To compare the applicability of different self-gating (SG) strategies for respiratory SG in cardiac MRI in combination with iteratively reconstructed (k-t SPARSE SENSE) cine data with low and high temporal resolution.


Methods

Eleven SG variants were compared in five volunteers by assessment of the resulting image sharpness compared with nongated reconstructions. Promising SG techniques were applied for high temporal resolution reconstructions of the heart function.


Results

SG was successful in all volunteers with image-based SG and the
∑{\textbar}{\textbar}p{\textbar}{\textbar} technique. These approaches were also superior to gating from the respiratory bellows signal on average. Combination with k-t SPARSE SENSE enabled high temporally resolved visualization of the heart motion with free breathing.


Conclusion

Respiratory SG can be applied for improving image sharpness. Combining SG with iterative reconstruction allows generation of high temporal resolution cine data, which reveal more details of cardiac motion. Magn Reson Med 73:292–298, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Gating performance was assessed by quantifying the levels of motion artifact observed in images and the degree of amplitude and phase stability in spectra.ResultsUser-defined gating with steady-state maintenance during respiration gave the best performance for mouse cardiac imaging, angiography, and spectroscopy, with a threefold increase in signal intensity and a sixfold reduction in noise intensity compared to cardiac gating only.ConclusionPhysiological gating with steady-state maintenance during respiration is essential for mouse cardiac MR at high magnetic fields.

	abstract = {Spectroscopic imaging with a one-dimensional phase-encoding gradient and surface-coil reception relies on the restricted range of sensitivity of the surface coil to provide localization in the dimensions transverse to the coil axis and consequently suffers from relatively poor localization in these dimensions. A two-dimensional (2D) cylindrically selective excitation pulse with a large spectral bandwidth is presented here to remedy this problem. The gradient waveforms are derived from multiple spirals in k space which form an overall pinwheel pattern, resulting in a pulse which is much shorter than the equivalent single-spiral trajectory. Nonuniform traversal of the spirals further reduces the pulse width under conditions of gradient slew-rate limitations, yielding overall gains in bandwidth of up to about 30 compared with the equivalent single-spiral trajectory traversed at constant angular rate. The accompanying rf waveform is obtained by weighted 2D Fourier transformation of the desired sensitivity profile. A new weighting factor is introduced into the rf waveform to compensate for nonuniform sampling of k space by the pinwheel near the origin. This factor is independent of the weighting used to account for the rate of traversal of the trajectory and is applicable to 2D pulse design in general. Pulse sequences employing pinwheel excitation in conjunction with either phase-encoding or slice-selective inversion are used to produce multiple-voxel and single-voxel localization in a human heart and a phantom. Pinwheel pulses may be used to advantage on moieties with long spin-lattice relaxation times and short transverse relaxation times and are therefore ideal for applications in phosphorus (13P) NMR. © 1991 Academic Press, Inc.},

In order to improve the quality of coil weight estimation sets of coil weights are averaged over the temporal dimension.ResultsThe kernel geometry leads to strongly decreased reconstruction times compared to the recently introduced k-t-GRAPPA using different kernel geometries with only one target point per kernel to fit. Improved results were obtained in terms of the root mean square error and the signal-to-noise ratio as demonstrated by in vivo cardiac imaging.ConclusionUsing a uniform kernel geometry for weight estimation with the properties of uncorrelated noise of different acquired timeframes, optimized results were achieved in terms of error level, signal-to-noise ratio, and reconstruction time.

At 1.5 T, a low-latency real-time feedback to balanced steady state free precision MR imaging was performed in three normal volunteers.

Although their formal description by use of the Bloch equations is straightforward, it does not lead to an intuitive understanding of their behavior except for the special cases of 180° or 90° pulses, especially when many pulses are applied before the magnetization has returned into thermal equilibrium. The extended-phasegraph algorithm, which takes into account that the total magnetization in spin-echo sequences is a superposition of many isochromats, allows the recognition of all possible echo signals in arbitrary pulse sequences. Its application to multi-echo sequences leads to a number of surprising results. It can be demonstrated that refocusing pulses with flip angles much lower than 180° generate an unexpectedly high signal intensity after a few echo periods. Apart from leading to a simple algorithm for the exact calculation of echo intensities in arbitrary multi-pulse sequences, the phase-graph algorithm leads to a simple understanding of the contrast behavior of different gradient echo sequences and gives a rational means for the design of MR-imaging sequences that are free from spurious echoes.},

	abstract = {Background Noninvasive measurement of absolute coronary arterial flow and coronary flow reserve would be of considerable use in the diagnosis and management of patients with coronary artery disease. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to measure flow in a variety of vessels. The goal of the present study was to determine if MRI measurements of coronary artery flow in a single breath-hold can be used to determine flow reserve and the severity of pericardial stenosis.
Methods and Results In eight mongrel dogs, a closed chest model of partial left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion was created. Coronary flows in the left circumflex artery (LCx) and LAD were measured at rest and during adenosine infusion using velocity-encoded, breath-hold MRI and perivascular ultrasound (US) flowmeters. MRI measurements of absolute coronary flow and coronary flow reserve were highly correlated with US (r=.96 and .94, respectively). Flow reserve measured in the constricted LAD was significantly lower than that in the unconstricted LCx by both US (P=.002) and MRI (P=.011).
Conclusions MRI measurements of coronary flow and flow reserve were in good agreement with US measurements. In addition, MRI measurements of coronary flow reserve successfully discriminated stenotic from normal vessels. These results indicate that MRI is a useful method for the noninvasive assessment of coronary flow and stenosis.},

	abstract = {OBJECT: To design and evaluate a fully shielded, λ/4 stripline resonator as a receive-only surface coil for preclinical MRI at 4.7 T.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 20 mm diameter stripline surface coil was fabricated from double-sided Duroid 5880 PCB material and was directly coupled to the input of a MOSFET preamplifier, without requiring a matching network. The new coil was compared with a conventional 20 mm, wire loop, receive-only surface coil in imaging experiments with a separate transmit-only saddle coil.
RESULTS: The stripline surface coil exhibits a loaded Q-factor of 132 at 200 MHz, compared to 138 for a conventional wire loop coil and its resonant frequency drops by 0.2 MHz under loading, rather than 0.5 MHz for the wire loop. The stripline coil displays a more symmetrical B1 map compared to the wire loop, but the SNR falls off more rapidly with depth so it is 30\% poorer 8 mm from the coil plane. It should be possible, however, to reduce this difference by using a thicker dielectric in future versions of the stripline coil.
CONCLUSION: Compared to a conventional surface coil, the stripline coil is easy to manufacture, requires shorter set-up times and shows reduced dielectric interaction with conductive samples.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of magnetic resonance phase contrast volume flow measurements in small blood vessels is expected to be smaller than in large vessels, because of partial volume effects at the vessel boundary. Accuracy was validated in the dog femoral artery, diameter 3.5 +/- 0.7 mm, using an ultrasonic transit-time flowmeter (TT). The number of pixels per vessel diameter (ND) ranged from 1.6 to 4.8. The vessel cross-section was determined using a threshold in the magnitude image. Between the two methods the correlation coefficient was 0.95 (range 10-200 ml/min). The proportional difference (PD), (QTT-QMR)/1/2(QTT+QMR), was 0.8\%, showing no systematic difference between the methods. The PDs standard deviation was 27\%, and 19\% for flow rates above 30 ml/min. Only a significant decrease of the PDs variance was found at the highest ND values, suggesting other sources of error than partial volume effects. It is concluded that with an ND value of about 3, accurate blood volume flow rates can be determined.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To assess the accuracy and repeatability of Fourier velocity encoded (FVE) M-mode and two-dimensional (2D) phase contrast with through-plane velocity encoding (2D-PC) for pulse wave velocity (PWV) evaluation in the descending aorta using five different analysis techniques.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Accuracy experiments were conducted on a tubular human-tissue-mimicking phantom integrated into a flow simulator. The theoretical PWV value was derived from the Moens-Korteweg equation after measurement of the tube elastic modulus by uniaxial tensile testing (PWV = 6.6 +/- 0.7 m/s). Repeatability was assessed on 20 healthy volunteers undergoing three consecutive MR examinations.


RESULTS

FVE M-mode PWV was more repeatable than 2D-PC PWV independently of the analysis technique used. The early systolic fit (ESF) method, followed by the maximum of the first derivative (1st der.) method, was the most accurate (PWV = 6.8 +/- 0.4 m/s and PWV = 7.0 +/- 0.6 m/s, respectively) and repeatable (inter-scan within-subject variation delta = 0.096 and delta = 0.107, respectively) for FVE M-mode. For 2D-PC, the 1st der. method performed best in terms of accuracy (PWV = 6.8 +/- 1.1 m/s), whereas the ESF algorithm was the most repeatable (delta = 0.386).


CONCLUSION

FVE M-mode allows rapid, accurate and repeatable central PWV evaluation when the ESF algorithm is used. 2D-PC requires long scan times and can provide accurate although much less repeatable PWV measurements when the 1st der. method is used.},

These were compared with the systolic time intervals corrected for heart rate and sex in 211 normal subjects. The failing left ventricle is characterized by a prolongation in the systolic pre-ejection period and a diminution in the left ventricular ejection time while total electromechanical systole remains relatively unaltered. Both components of the pre-ejection period, the Q-1 interval and the isovolumic contraction time, were prolonged. These alterations in the phases of systole occur in the absence of a measurable change in ventricular depolarization time. The prolongation in the pre-ejection period is well correlated with the reduced stroke volume and cardiac output in heart failure and is independently augmented by high levels of arterial pressure. The abbreviation in left ventricular ejection time is also correlated significantly with the stroke volume and cardiac output. It is postulated that a defect in the mechanical performance of the heart is responsible for the abnormal systolic time intervals in human heart failure.},

Radial and longitudinal ventricular function can be assessed by the analysis of myocardial wall velocity and displacement indices, or by the analysis of wall deformation using the rate of deformation of a myocardial segment (strain rate) and its deformation over time (strain). A quick and easy assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction is obtained by mitral annular velocity measurement during a routine study, especially in patients with poor endocardial definition or abnormal septal motion. Strain rate and strain are less affected by passive myocardial motion and tend to be uniform throughout the left ventricle in normal subjects.

PWTD is a novel ultrasound method to quantify myocardial contraction and relaxation velocities. In 27 young normal subjects, PWTD peak values of longitudinal systolic and diastolic velocities were measured for 12 left ventricular segments visualized from the apical window. The PWTD sampling of each myocardial segment resulted in a triphasic velocity curve during each cardiac cycle: a systolic velocity wave (S) directed toward the transducer, and an early diastolic (E) and a late diastolic (A) velocity wave away from the transducer. A heterogeneous pattern of systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities was observed between individual wall segments as well as for the basal and midsegments of each myocardial wall. The difference between the highest and lowest values for S was 38.4\% in the basal segments and 56.3\% in the midwall segments. The difference between low and high velocities for E was 61.4\% in the basal and 38.2\% in the midsegments; for A the difference was 29.5\% in the basal and 32.6\% in the midsegments. In general, lower velocity values were found in the septum with higher basal to midwall difference. The lateral and posterior walls had higher, but more uniform, velocities. PWTD enables the quantitative assessment of regional systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Substantial heterogeneity of velocities exists within individual myocardial segments, and must be taken into account in any clinical application. The observed heterogeneity in longitudinal function is consistent with the known spatial distribution of myocardial fibers.},

Although an inherent loss of SNR in parallel MRI is inevitable due to the reduced measurement time, the sensitivity to image artifacts that result from severe undersampling can be ameliorated by alternative reconstruction methods. While the introduction of GRAPPA and SENSE extended MRI reconstructions from a simple unitary transformation (Fourier transform) to the inversion of an ill-conditioned linear system, the next logical step is the use of a nonlinear inversion. Here, a respective algorithm based on a Newton-type method with appropriate regularization terms is demonstrated to improve the performance of autocalibrating parallel MRI—mainly due to a better estimation of the coil sensitivity profiles. The approach yields images with considerably reduced artifacts for high acceleration factors and/or a low number of reference lines. Magn Reson Med, 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background—Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) typically quantifies LV mass (LVM) by means of manual planimetry (MP), but this approach is time-consuming and does not account for partial voxel components— myocardium admixed with blood in a single voxel. Automated segmentation (AS) can account for partial voxels, but this has not been used for LVM quantification. This study used automated CMR segmentation to test the influence of partial voxels on quantification of LVM.
Methods and Results—LVM was quantified by AS and MP in 126 consecutive patients and 10 laboratory animals undergoing CMR. AS yielded both partial voxel (ASPV) and full voxel (ASFV) measurements. Methods were independently compared with LVM quantified on echocardiography (echo) and an ex vivo standard of LVM at necropsy. AS quantified LVM in all patients, yielding a 12-fold decrease in processing time versus MP (0:21±0:04 versus 4:18±1:02 minutes; P{\textless}0.001). ASFV mass (136±35 g) was slightly lower than MP (139±35; Δ=3±9 g, P{\textless}0.001). Both methods yielded similar proportions of patients with LV remodeling (P=0.73) and hypertrophy (P=1.00). Regarding partial voxel segmentation, ASPV yielded higher LVM (159±38 g) than MP (Δ=20±10 g) and ASFV (Δ=23±6 g, both P{\textless}0.001), corresponding to relative increases of 14\% and 17\%. In multivariable analysis, magnitude of difference between ASPV and ASFV correlated with larger voxel size (partial r=0.37, P{\textless}0.001) even after controlling for LV chamber volume (r=0.28, P=0.002) and total LVM (r=0.19, P=0.03). Among patients, ASPV yielded better agreement with echo (Δ=20±25 g) than did ASFV (Δ=43±24 g) or MP (Δ=40±22 g, both P{\textless}0.001). Among laboratory animals, ASPV and ex vivo results were similar (Δ=1±3 g, P=0.3), whereas ASFV (6±3 g, P{\textless}0.001) and MP (4±5 g, P=0.02) yielded small but significant differences with LVM at necropsy.
Conclusions—Automated segmentation of myocardial partial voxels yields a 14–17\% increase in LVM versus full voxel segmentation, with increased differences correlated with lower spatial resolution. Partial voxel segmentation yields improved CMR agreement with echo and necropsy-verified LVM.},

Cardiac performance was enhanced during immersion compared with nonimmersion, whereas it was depressed by breath holding at large lung volume. The depressed performance was apparent from the decrease in cardiac index (24.1\% in the immersed and 20.9\% in the nonimmersed condition) and from changes in systolic time intervals, e.g., shortening of left ventricular ejection time coupled with lengthening of preejection period.

The method feeds on physiological signals and x-f space properties of dynamic series to invert a coupled system of linear equations. The unknowns solved for represent the parameters for a linear nonrigid motion model and the parameters for a linear contrast-change model based on B-splines. Performance is demonstrated on myocardial perfusion imaging, on six simulated data sets and six clinical exams. The main purpose consists in removing motion-induced errors from time-intensity curves, thus improving curve analysis and postprocessing in general.

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16685881},
	abstract = {Subject motion appears to be a limiting factor in numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. For head imaging the subject's ability to maintain the same head position for a considerable period of time places restrictions on the total acquisition time. For healthy individuals this time typically does not exceed 10 minutes and may be considerably reduced in case of pathology. In particular, head tremor, which often accompanies stroke, may render certain high-resolution 2D and 3D techniques inapplicable. Several navigator techniques have been proposed to circumvent the subject motion problem. The most suitable for head imaging appears to be the orbital or spherical navigator methods. Navigators, however, not only lengthen the measurement because of the time required for acquisition of the position information, but also require additional excitation radio frequency (RF) pulses to be incorporated into the sequence timing, which disturbs the steady state. Here we demonstrate the possibility of interfacing the MR scanner with an external optical motion tracking system, capable of determining the object's position with sub-millimeter accuracy and an update rate of 60Hz. The movement information on the object position (head) is used to compensate the motion in real time. This is done by updating the field of view (FOV) by recalculating the gradients and the RF-parameter of the MRI tomograph during the acquisition of k-space data based on the tracking data. Results of rotation phantom, in vivo experiments and the implementation in two different MRI sequences are presented.},

This is even more the case when ECG is acquired during magnetic resonance (MR) examination. The MR environment highly distorts ECG, with Hall effect, due to the important static magnetic field, and artifacts, caused by fast switching magnetic field gradients. Detection of QRS complexes is then affected. In this paper, a new specific MR QRS detector is presented. This method is based on the modulus maximum lines and on the Lipschitz exponent estimation they offer. The use of this regularity characterization enables to distinguish between QRS complexes and MR artifacts.

To date, no detailed analysis has been presented describing the dependence of the image quality on the reconstruction and acquisition parameters such as the number of autocalibration signal (ACS) lines NACS, the reconstruction kernel size (bx × by), and the undersampling factor R. To evaluate their influence on the performance of generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions, two phantom data sets acquired with 12-channel and 32-channel receive coils and three in vivo measurements were analyzed. Reconstruction parameters were systematically varied between R = 2–4, NACS = 4–64, bx = 1–9, and by = 2–10 to characterize their influence on image quality and noise. A main aspect of the analysis was to optimize the parameter set with respect to the effectively achieved net image acceleration. Selecting the undersampling factor R as small as possible for a given net acceleration yielded the best result in a clear majority of cases. For all data sets and coil geometries, the optimal kernel sizes and number of ACS lines were similar for a chosen undersampling factor R. In summary, the number of ACS lines should not be chosen below NACS = 10–16. A robust choice for the kernel size was bx = 9 and by = 2–4. Magn Reson Med, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Since flow-limiting stenoses have already undergone compensatory vasodilatation to maintain flow, the response to vasoactive stimulation is dampened. The degree of response limitation is reflected by the coronary flow reserve (CFR). Absolute volume flow rates can be accurately and noninvasively measured with MRI techniques. The purpose was to assess the ability to measure coronary volume flow rate noninvasively, and characterize the effect of pharmacologic stress on coronary flow quantitatively by using ultrafast, breath-held segmented k-space phase-contrast-MR imaging (PC-MRI). Ten healthy volunteers were examined by using ultrafast breath-held PC-MRI. Coronary volume flow rates were measured in the anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) at rest and following intravenous administration of dipyridamole. CFR was determined based on these data. Mean LAD volume flow rates increased from 38 +/- 11 ml/min before application of dipyridamole to 169 +/- 42 ml/min. The mean CFR amounted to 5.0 +/- 2.6 (median = 4.15). This study demonstrates the feasibility of breath-held PC-MRI to noninvasively quantify coronary volume flow rates over the cardiac cycle. Pharmacologically induced changes in volume flow rate and thus CFR can be quantitated.},

In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a new prospective motion correction technique, called PROMO, as applied to making neuroanatomical measures in typically developing school-age children. This method attempts to address the problem of motion at its source by keeping the measurement coordinate system fixed with respect to the subject throughout image acquisition. The technique also performs automatic rescanning of images that were acquired during intervals of particularly severe motion. Unlike many previous techniques, this approach adjusts for both in-plane and through-plane movement, greatly reducing image artifacts without the need for additional equipment. Results show that the use of PROMO notably enhances subjective image quality, reduces errors in Freesurfer cortical surface reconstructions, and significantly improves the subcortical volumetric segmentation of brain structures.

Segments covering the central k-space, i.e. those with significant signal contributions, are averaged more often than the (outer) segments with low RF amplitudes and minor signal contributions. For compensation, these outer segments are applied with an increased RF amplitude, i.e. a larger flip angle, such that an unaltered signal contribution is obtained in a reduced number of shots. Numerical simulations and experiments in phantoms and the human brain in vivo demonstrate that the approach considerably increases the signal efficiency, i.e. the signal accumulated per time unit, without introducing profile distortions. Its application to single-voxel MR spectroscopy of a corpus-callosum-shaped region-of-interest yielded, due to an optimum coverage of the target volume, higher signal amplitudes than conventional localization based on cross-sectional RF excitations. Thus, the approach could improve the reliability of single-voxel MR spectroscopy. Magn Reson Med, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To compare velocity-encoded (VE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with tissue Doppler imaging to assess right ventricular (RV) peak systolic velocities and timing of velocities in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot and healthy subjects.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Local institutional review board approval was obtained; patients or their parents gave informed consent. Thirty-three patients (20 male, 13 female; median age, 12 years; interquartile range [IQR], 11-15 years; age range, 8-18 years) and 19 control subjects (12 male, seven female; median age, 14 years; IQR, 12-16 years; age range, 8-18 years) underwent VE MR imaging and tissue Doppler imaging. Peak systolic velocity and time to peak systolic velocity (percentage of cardiac cycle) were assessed at the RV free wall (RVFW) and RV outflow tract (RVOT). Data were analyzed by using linear regression, paired and unpaired tests, and Bland-Altman plots.


RESULTS

Good correlation and agreement between the two techniques were observed. For peak systolic velocity at RVFW, r = 0.95 (mean difference, -0.4 cm/sec, P {\textless} .01), and at RVOT, r = 0.95 (mean difference, -0.4 cm/sec, P = .02). For timing at RVFW, r = 0.94 (mean difference, -0.2\%, P = .44), and at RVOT, r = 0.89 (mean difference, -0.5\%, P = .01). Peak systolic velocity was reduced in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot (at RVFW, median was 8.2 cm/sec [IQR, 6.4-9.7 cm/sec] vs 12.4 cm/sec [IQR, 10.8-13.8 cm/sec], P {\textless} .01; at RVOT, 4.7 cm/sec [IQR, 4.1-7.2 cm/sec] vs 10.2 cm/sec [IQR, 8.7-11.2 cm/sec], P {\textless} .01). The time delay between RVFW and RVOT was observed, which was significantly shorter in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot (median, 5.9\% [IQR, 4.9\%-7.4\%] vs 8.4\% [IQR, 6.6\%-12.4\%], P {\textless} .01).


CONCLUSION

VE MR imaging and tissue Doppler imaging enable assessment of RV systolic performance and timing of velocities at the RVFW and RVOT in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot. Both techniques can be used interchangeably to clinically assess velocities and timing of velocities of the RV.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Cardiac Cine-MRI combines data acquired in different cycles of variable lengths to reconstruct images. This study aims at assessing the temporal misalignment induced by different methods for combining k-space lines.
Methods
The durations of the six cardiac stages of 306 cardiac cycles were assessed with Tissue-Doppler Imaging in a population of 7 children and young adults. Different models from the literature (Chung and Feinstein), and adaptive two-stage and six-stage models were used to combine these cardiac cycles. Temporal shift between the modelized and the real positions within the cycles were recorded.
Results
The averages of the 95\% confidence limits of temporal misalignments caused by two-stage models were between 20 and 30ms but during early diastole they reached 40-50 ms. Chung's model behaved slightly better than Feinstein's (26 ms vs 31 ms, p\&lt;0.001). The adaptive models significantly reduced time misalignments (22 ms vs 26 ms, p\&lt;0.001 for the 2-stage model and 18ms vs 22ms, p\&lt;0.001 for the six-stage model).
Conclusion
There is a theoretical limitation to high temporal resolution cardiac acquisitions due to time misalignments during cine reconstruction, at least within a pediatric population. Simple personalized adaptive cardiac models may reduce this limitation.

	abstract = {Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tagging has been established as an essential technique for measuring regional myocardial function. It allows quantification of local intramyocardial motion measures, e.g. strain and strain rate. The invention of CMR tagging came in the late eighties, where the technique allowed for the first time for visualizing transmural myocardial movement without having to implant physical markers. This new idea opened the door for a series of developments and improvements that continue up to the present time. Different tagging techniques are currently available that are more extensive, improved, and sophisticated than they were twenty years ago. Each of these techniques has different versions for improved resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), scan time, anatomical coverage, three-dimensional capability, and image quality. The tagging techniques covered in this article can be broadly divided into two main categories: 1) Basic techniques, which include magnetization saturation, spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM), delay alternating with nutations for tailored excitation (DANTE), and complementary SPAMM (CSPAMM); and 2) Advanced techniques, which include harmonic phase (HARP), displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE), and strain encoding (SENC). Although most of these techniques were developed by separate groups and evolved from different backgrounds, they are in fact closely related to each other, and they can be interpreted from more than one perspective. Some of these techniques even followed parallel paths of developments, as illustrated in the article. As each technique has its own advantages, some efforts have been made to combine different techniques together for improved image quality or composite information acquisition. In this review, different developments in pulse sequences and related image processing techniques are described along with the necessities that led to their invention, which makes this article easy to read and the covered techniques easy to follow. Major studies that applied CMR tagging for studying myocardial mechanics are also summarized. Finally, the current article includes a plethora of ideas and techniques with over 300 references that motivate the reader to think about the future of CMR tagging.},

Gender-specific differences in cardiovascular risk are well known, and current evidence supports an existing role of endothelium in these differences. The purpose of this study was to assess non invasively coronary endothelial function in male and female young volunteers by myocardial blood flow (MBF) measurement using coronary sinus (CS) flow quantification by velocity encoded cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) at rest and during cold pressor test (CPT).


METHODS

Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 men, 12 women) underwent CMR in a 3 Tesla MR imager. Coronary sinus flow was measured at rest and during CPT using non breath-hold velocity encoded phase contrast cine-CMR. Myocardial function and morphology were acquired using a cine steady-state free precession sequence.


RESULTS

At baseline, mean MBF was 0.63 ± 0.23 mL·g⁻¹·min⁻¹ in men and 0.79 ± 0.21 mL·g⁻¹·min⁻¹ in women. During CPT, the rate pressure product in men significantly increased by 49 ± 36\% (p {\textless} 0.0001) and in women by 52 ± 22\% (p {\textless} 0.0001). MBF increased significantly in both men and women by 0.22 ± 0.19 mL·g⁻¹·min⁻¹ (p = 0.0022) and by 0.73 ± 0.43 mL·g⁻¹·min⁻¹ (p = 0.0001), respectively. The increase in MBF was significantly higher in women than in men (p = 0.0012).


CONCLUSION

CMR coronary sinus flow quantification for measuring myocardial blood flow revealed a higher response of MBF to CPT in women than in men. This finding may reflect gender differences in endothelial-dependent vasodilatation in these young subjects. This non invasive rest/stress protocol may become helpful to study endothelial function in normal physiology and in physiopathology.},

	abstract = {Background—Conventional x-ray angiography frequently underestimates the true burden of atherosclerosis. Although intravascular ultrasound allows for imaging of coronary plaque, this invasive technique is inappropriate for screening or serial examinations. We therefore sought to develop a noninvasive free-breathing MR technique for coronary vessel wall imaging. We hypothesized that such an approach would allow for in vivo imaging of coronary atherosclerosis.
Methods and Results—Ten subjects, including 5 healthy adult volunteers (aged 35±17 years, range 19 to 56 years) and 5 patients (aged 60±4 years, range 56 to 66 years) with x-ray–confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD), were studied with a T2-weighted, dual-inversion, fast spin-echo MR sequence. Multiple adjacent 5-mm cross-sectional images of the proximal right coronary artery were obtained with an in-plane resolution of 0.5x1.0 mm. A right hemidiaphragmatic navigator was used to facilitate free-breathing MR acquisition. Coronary vessel wall images were readily acquired in all subjects. Both coronary vessel wall thickness (1.5±0.2 versus 1.0±0.2 mm) and wall area (21.2±3.1 versus 13.7±4.2 mm2) were greater in patients with CAD (both P{\textless}0.02 versus healthy adults).
Conclusions—In vivo free-breathing coronary vessel wall and plaque imaging with MR has been successfully implemented in humans. Coronary wall thickness and wall area were significantly greater in patients with angiographic CAD. The presented technique may have potential applications in patients with known or suspected atherosclerotic CAD or for serial evaluation after pharmacological intervention.},

	abstract = {Breath-hold velocity-encoded cine MR (VENC-MR) imaging is a feasible method for measuring phasic blood flow velocity in small vessels that move during respiration. The purposes of the current study are to compare breathhold VENC-MR measurements of flow velocities in the internal mammary arteries (IMA) with nonbreath-hold measurements and to characterize the systolic and diastolic flow velocity curves in a cardiac cycle in native IMA and IMA grafts. Flow velocity in 30 native IMA and 8 IMA grafts were evaluated with a breath-hold VENC-MR sequence with K-space segmentation and view-sharing reconstruction (TR/TE = 16/9 msec, VENC = 100 cm/s). In 10 native IMA, nonbreath-hold VENC-MR images were acquired as well for comparison. Breath-hold VENC-MR imaging showed significantly higher systolic and diastolic peak velocities in native IMA (43.1 cm/second +/- 15.0 and 10.0 cm/second +/- 4.8), in comparison to those of nonbreath-hold VENC-MR imaging (27.6 cm/second +/- 10.2 and 7.3 cm/second +/- 3.9, P {\textless} .05). The diastolic/systolic peak velocity ratio in the IMA grafts (.88 +/- .41) was significantly higher than that in native IMA (.24 +/- .08, P {\textless} .01). Interobserver variability in the flow velocity measurement was less than 4\%. Breath-hold VENC-MR imaging demonstrated higher peak flow velocity in the IMA than nonbreath-hold VENC-MR imaging. This technique is a rapid and effective method for the noninvasive assessment of blood flow velocity in IMA grafts.},

	abstract = {Magnitude subtraction and complex subtraction in dynamic contrast-enhanced three-dimensional magnetic resonance (3D-MR) angiography were compared using a phantom and 23 human subjects. In phantom studies, complex subtraction showed far better performance than magnitude subtraction, especially for longer echo times, with thicker slices, and without fat suppression. With complex subtraction, non-fat-suppressed studies showed contrast-to-noise ratios comparable to those in fat-suppressed studies. In human subjects, complex subtraction was superior to magnitude subtraction in 9 subjects, but comparable to magnitude subtraction in 14 subjects. There were no cases in which magnitude subtraction was superior to complex subtraction. Although the differences observed in human studies when complex subtraction was applied with thinner slices, shorter echo times, and the fat-suppression technique were not as pronounced as those seen in phantom studies, complex subtraction should be performed in dynamic contrast-enhanced 3D-MR angiography because there are no drawbacks in complex subtraction. Further research is necessary to assess the feasibility of dynamic contrast-enhanced 3D-MR angiography without fat suppression in human subjects using complex subtraction, as suggested by the results of phantom studies. If it is found to be feasible, dynamic contrast-enhanced 3D-MR angiography without fat suppression using complex subtraction may prove to be a robust technique that eliminates the need for shimming and can reduce the acquisition time.

	abstract = {OBJECT: Phase contrast imaging is widely used to measure blood velocity. However tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography is the reference for myocardial velocity assessment. This study aims at validating the ability of phase contrast (PC) sequences to correctly assess myocardial velocities and to compare these velocities to TDI. The phase contrast sequence was performed with breath-hold parameters and with parameters tuned to increase temporal resolution in free breathing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Left and Right auriculo-ventricular annuluses longitudinal velocities were recorded on six healthy volunteers with different temporal resolutions (TDI: 5 ms, breath-hold PC: 94 ms and free-breathing PC: 19 ms). Free-breathing PC was obtained by averaging of three excitations. Amplitudes of four standard echocardiographic and clinically relevant myocardial longitudinal velocity waves were compared: Early filling and auricular, systolic and isovolumic contractions.
RESULTS: Isovolumic contraction waves were only visible with free-breathing PC and TDI. The differences with the reference TDI wave velocities were lower (p = 0.02) for free-breathing PC (19.2 ± 2.6 \%) than for breath-hold PC (28.1 ± 2.9 \%). These differences for free-breathing PC were close to (p = 0.21) the coefficient of variation of the measurements provided by TDI (14.8 ± 1.2 \%).
CONCLUSION: Myocardial longitudinal peak velocities can be assessed with a PC sequence tuned to optimize temporal resolution.},

Augmenting stroke volume was found to prolong ejection, shorten the isovolumic period and had little or no effect on the duration of total systole. Elevating mean aortic blood pressure shortened ejection time, prolonged the isovolumic phase and either had no effect or decreased slightly the duration of total systole. Increasing heart rate at constant aortic pressure and stroke volume reduced the duration of all phases of systole. Digitalis and norepinephrine shortened all phases of systole.
These findings demonstrate that the duration of each phase of left ventricular systole is dependent upon existing hemodynamic conditions as well as on the contractile state of the myocardium. By means of intrinsic mechanisms the ventricle exhibits the remarkable capability of being able to adjust the duration of each phase of systole in a manner appropriate to changing hemodynamic conditions.},

Furthermore, an objective quantitative comparison between images acquired with different scanning methods is desirable. To address this need, a software tool (“Soap-Bubble”) that facilitates visualization and quantitative comparison of 3D volume targeted coronary MRA data was developed. In the present implementation, the user interactively specifies a curved subvolume (enclosed in the 3D coronary MRA data set) that closely encompasses the coronary arterial segments. With a 3D Delaunay triangulation and a parallel projection, this enables the simultaneous display of multiple coronary segments in one 2D representation. For objective quantitative analysis, frequently explored quantitative parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR); and vessel length, sharpness, and diameter can be assessed. The present tool supports visualization and objective, quantitative comparisons of coronary MRA data obtained with different scanning methods.

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging-guided high intensity focused ultrasound is a promising method for the noninvasive ablation of pathological tissue in abdominal organs such as liver and kidney. Due to the high perfusion rates of these organs, sustained sonications are required to achieve a sufficiently high temperature elevation to induce necrosis. However, the constant displacement of the target due to the respiratory cycle render continuous ablations challenging, since dynamic repositioning of the focal point is required. This study demonstrates subsecond 3D high intensity focused ultrasound-beam steering under magnetic resonance-guidance for the real-time compensation of respiratory motion. The target is observed in 3D space by coupling rapid 2D magnetic resonance-imaging with prospective slice tracking based on pencil-beam navigator echoes. The magnetic resonance-data is processed in real-time by a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline, which provides the position, the temperature and the thermal dose on-the-fly, and which feeds corrections into the high intensity focused ultrasound-ablator. The effect of the residual update latency is reduced by using a 3D Kalman-predictor for trajectory anticipation. The suggested method is characterized with phantom experiments and verified in vivo on porcine kidney. The results show that for update frequencies of more than 10 Hz and latencies of less then 114 msec, temperature elevations can be achieved, which are comparable to static experiments.

	abstract = {The temporal and spatial resolution of real-time phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) is restricted by the need to acquire two interleaved phase images. In this article, we propose a split-acquisition real-time CINE PCMR technique, where the acquisition of flow-encoded and flow-compensated data is divided into separate blocks. By comparing magnitude images, automatic matching of data in cardio-respiratory space allows subtraction of background phase offsets. Thus, the data is acquired in real-time but with phase correction originating from a different heart beat. This effectively doubles the frame rate, allowing either higher temporal or spatial resolution. Two split-acquisition sequences were tested: one with high-temporal resolution and one with high-spatial resolution. Both sequences showed excellent agreement in stroke volumes in 20 adults when validated against cardiac-gated PCMR and interleaved real-time PCMR (cardiac gated: 95.2 ± 20.0 mL, interleaved real-time: 96.2 ± 20.7 mL, high-temporal resolution: 95.6 ± 20.1 mL, high-spatial resolution: 95.5 ± 20.4 mL). In six children, the high-spatial resolution sequence provided more accurate flow measurements than interleaved real-time PCMR, when compared with cardiac-gated PCMR (cardiac gated: 20.6 ± 7.6 mL, interleaved real-time: 24.3 ± 9.2 mL, high-spatial resolution: 20.8 ± 7.8 mL), due to the increased spatial resolution. The matching technique is shown to be accurate (truth: 94.6 ± 21.8, split-acquisition: 95.0 ± 21.9 mL) and quantitative image quality (signal-to-noise ratio, velocity-to-noise ratio and edge sharpness) is acceptable.

	abstract = {OBJECT: Until now, a three-directional velocity field has mostly been obtained by velocity encoding in three directions, which is very time-consuming and hence not usually used in clinical routine. We show the feasibility of combining in-plane tagging with through-plane tissue phase mapping (TPM) to encode a three-directional velocity field at 3 T with reduced overall acquisition time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Assessment of a three-directional velocity field was performed for 10 healthy volunteers. The motion patterns obtained by use of five different sequences including three-directional TPM, TPM in the through-plane direction, TPM in the through-plane direction with horizontal or vertical tagging lines, and TPM in the through-plane direction combined with a tagging grid were evaluated and compared.
RESULTS: A three-dimensional velocity field can be obtained in approximately half the acquisition time by combining through-plane TPM with in-plane tagging. Although the velocity information is derived by different means, differences between the information obtained by three-directional TPM encoding and the suggested technique are only minor.
CONCLUSION: The combination of tagging and TPM enables assessment of the three-directional velocity field in nearly half the time taken when the conventional three-directional TPM sequence is used.},

	abstract = {Phase unwrapping algorithm plays very important role in noncontract optical profilometry, beacuse the phase map acquired derectly is limited from π to −π, which is called wrapped phase. It must be unwrapped to retrieve the nature phase employing suitable phase unwrapping algorithm. In this paper, we review a phase unwrapping algorithm based on the reliability-guided parameter map. In this algorithm we select a parameter or group of parameters to identify the reliability of the phase data or the direction of phase unwrapping. The path of phase unwrapping is guided according to the parameter map. It means that the pixel with higher parameter value in the parameter map will be phase unwrapped earlier. The intensity modulation and the spatial frequency of the fringe pattern are usually used as important parameters characterizing the reliability. Other parameters, such as the phase difference between neighboring pixels, the signal-to-noise ratio, or some band elimination filter center around defect region assigned by user, could be selected as the optimized parameter for phase unwrapping. Sometimes we can combine two or three parameters to produce a more optimized parameter map for phase unwrapping. The advantage of this approach is that the path of phase unwrapping is always along the direction from the pixel with higher reliability value to the pixel with low reliability value. Therefore, in the worse case the error is limited, if there is any, to local minimum areas.},

The purpose of the study was to assess ventricular volumes by using three-dimensional (3D) whole-heart data sets acquired during end-systolic and end-diastolic phases during one free-breathing magnetic resonance imaging examination. In five healthy volunteers and 10 patients, 3D dual cardiac phase data sets, short-axis multisection breath-hold images, and through-plane flow images of the great vessels were acquired. Within these data sets, statistic analyses were performed to compare stroke, end-systolic, and end-diastolic volumes for the left ventricle (LV) and the right ventricle (RV). Results showed that the breath-hold multisection approach, the flow measurement approach, and the new dual-phase 3D approach delivered comparable results for quantification of cardiac volumes and function. High correlation values greater than 0.95 were found when these methods were compared, and no significant differences were recognized for stroke, end-systolic, or end-diastolic volumes in either the LV or the RV.© RSNA, 2008},

Comparison between images acquired using segmented breath-held turbo-FLASH and averaged, motion-corrected, free-breathing true-FISP show excellent agreement of measured CNR and infarct size.

Peak systolic velocities in the main pulmonary artery determined by VEC MR correlated well with the measurements obtained by using continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography (r = .91). Stroke volumes measured at the aorta by VEC MR and continuous-wave Doppler imaging also correlated well with each other (r = .80). VEC MR measurements of aortic and pulmonary flow provided left and right ventricular stroke volumes that correlated well with left ventricular stroke volumes determined by short-axis cine MR images (r = .98, SEE = 3.7 ml, and r = .95, SEE = 4.8 ml, respectively). Intra- and interobserver variabilities were small for both left and right ventricular stroke volumes as measured with VEC MR. These results indicate that VEC MR accurately and reproducibly measures aortic and pulmonary flow velocities and volumes in the physiologic range of humans, and can be used to measure right and left ventricular stroke volumes under normal flow conditions.},

	abstract = {Purpose 
To assess the feasibility and potential limitations of the acceleration techniques SENSE and k-t BLAST for time-resolved three-dimensional (3D) velocity mapping of aortic blood flow. Furthermore, to quantify differences in peak velocity versus heart phase curves. 
Materials and methods 
Time-resolved 3D blood flow patterns were investigated in eleven volunteers and two patients suffering from aortic diseases with accelerated PC-MR sequences either in combination with SENSE (R = 2) or k-t BLAST (6-fold). Both sequences showed similar data acquisition times and hence acceleration efficiency. Flow-field streamlines were calculated and visualized using the GTFlow software tool in order to reconstruct 3D aortic blood flow patterns. Differences between the peak velocities from single-slice PC-MRI experiments using SENSE 2 and k-t BLAST 6 were calculated for the whole cardiac cycle and averaged for all volunteers. 
Results 
Reconstruction of 3D flow patterns in volunteers revealed attenuations in blood flow dynamics for k-t BLAST 6 compared to SENSE 2 in terms of 3D streamlines showing fewer and less distinct vortices and reduction in peak velocity, which is caused by temporal blurring. Solely by time-resolved 3D MR velocity mapping in combination with SENSE detected pathologic blood flow patterns in patients with aortic diseases. For volunteers, we found a broadening and flattering of the peak velocity versus heart phase diagram between the two acceleration techniques, which is an evidence for the temporal blurring of the k-t BLAST approach. 
Conclusion 
We demonstrated the feasibility of SENSE and detected potential limitations of k-t BLAST when used for time-resolved 3D velocity mapping. The effects of higher k-t BLAST acceleration factors have to be considered for application in 3D velocity mapping.},

Each method has a unique mechanism, which is described in detail. A theoretical investigation has been conducted into the effects that the methods have on the point spread function of a moving point. Data acquired in Fourier imaging are actually in the spatial frequency domain, so that respiratory motion can be regarded as a function of spatial frequency. The four methods above modify this functional dependence in different ways, allowing a unified comparison. Motion artifact suppression imposes additional constraints on image acquisition, which can prolong the imaging time. A technique has been developed that keeps the imaging time short by using the configuration of the subject to regulate the timing of image acquisition.},

Thus, images acquired at different heart phases do not always represent the same slice of the myocardium. A new myocardial tagging technique is presented, which takes the through-plane motion into consideration. It involves tagging of the desired myocardial slice and applying a subtraction imaging technique to image just that part of the myocardium. The examination time can be reduced considerably by the acquisition of two one-dimensionally tagged images. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio especially at later heart phases, variable imaging RF excitation flip angles are applied. To reduce motion artifacts a repetitive breathhold scheme was applied. in vivo results demonstrate that the tags can be accurately tracked within the entire heart period with a temporal resolution of 35 ms, even at a top basal level of the heart and right ventricle.},

Fast VENC MR images were obtained with a high-speed-gradient 1.5-T MR system in seven anesthetized dogs before and after administration of dipyridamole.

Cardiac imaging at 3T, however, is both subtly and significantly different from imaging at 1.5T because of increased susceptibility artifacts, differences in tissue relaxation, and RF homogeneity issues. New RF excitation and pulse sequence designs are presented which deal with the fat-suppression requirements and off-resonance issues at 3T. Real-time cardiac imaging at 3T is demonstrated with high blood SNR, blood-myocardium CNR, resolution, and image quality, using new spectral-spatial RF pulses and fast spiral gradient echo pulse sequences. The proposed sequence achieves 1.5 mm in-plane resolution over a 20 cm FOV, with a 5.52 mm measured slice thickness and 32 dB of lipid suppression.

Up to now whole volume coverage of the heart is still limited by the long acquisition times. Therefore, a significant increase in imaging speed without deterioration of quantitative motion information is indispensable.
METHODS: 20 volunteers were enrolled in this study. Each volunteer underwent myocardial short-axis TPM scans with different SENSE acceleration factors. The influence of SENSE acceleration on the measured motion curves was investigated.
RESULTS: It is demonstrated that all TPM sequences with SENSE acceleration have only minimum influence on the motion curves. Even with a SENSE factor of four, the decrease in the amplitude of the motion curve was less than 3\%. No significant difference was observed for the global correlation coefficient and deviation between the motion curves obtained by the reproducibility and the SENSE accelerated measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to accelerate myocardial TPM measurements with SENSE factors up to 4 without losing substantial information of the motion pattern.},

Pressure differences within a slice of interest can be calculated using only the in-plane velocity components from that slice. This rapid exam is proposed as an alternative to the lengthy 3D velocity imaging exams. Despite their good spatial coverage, the 3D exams are prone to artifacts and errors from respiratory motion and insufficient temporal resolution, and are unattractive in the clinical setting due to their excessive scan times ({\textgreater}10 min of free breathing). The proposed single-slice approach requires only one or two breath-holds of acquisition time, and the velocity data can be processed for the calculation of pressure differences online with immediate feedback. The impact of reducing the pressure difference calculation to two dimensions is quantified by comparison with 3D data sets for the case of blood flow within the cardiac chambers. The calculated pressure differences are validated using high-fidelity pressure transducers both in a pulsatile flow phantom and in vivo in a dog model. There was excellent agreement between the transducer and PC-MRI results in all of the studies. Magn Reson Med 49:1056–1066, 2003. Published 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose To evaluate a method to enable single-slice or multiple-slice cine phase contrast (cine-PC) acquisition during a single breath-hold using a highly sparsified radial acquisition ordering and temporally constrained image reconstruction with a spatially varying temporal constraint. Materials and Methods Simulated and in vivo cine-PC datasets of the proximal ascending aorta were obtained at different acceleration factors using a view projection acquisition order optimized for temporally constrained reconstruction (TCR). Reconstruction of the sparse cine-PC data performed with TCR was compared to reconstructions using zero-filled regridding and temporal interpolation. Results TCR resulted in more accurate velocity measurements than regridding or temporal interpolation. In one dataset, TCR of undersampled in vivo data (16 views per cardiac phase) resulted in a peak systolic velocity within 3.3\% of the value measured by Doppler ultrasound while shortening the scan time to 13 seconds. High temporal-resolution undersampled TCR was also compared lower temporal-resolution, more highly sampled, regridding in three normal volunteers. Conclusion TCR proved to be an effective method for reconstructing undersampled radial PC data. Although TCR utilizes a temporal constraint, temporal blurring was minimized by using appropriate constraint weights in addition to a spatially varying temporal constraint. TCR allowed for the acquisition time to be reduced to the duration of a breath-hold, while still resulting in accurate velocity measurements.J. Magn. Reson.

	abstract = {Objectives
We sought to assess right ventricular diastolic function in young patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary regurgitation.
Background
Pulmonary regurgitation is an important problem in repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Its effects on right ventricular diastolic function in children are unknown.
Methods
Nineteen children with repair of tetralogy of Fallot (mean age [Â±SD] 12 Â± 3 years, mean age at operation 1.5 Â± 1) and 12 healthy children were studied. Summation of magnetic resonance velocity mapping pulmonary and tricuspid volume flow curves provided right ventricular time-volume curves. Ventricular size was assessed with tomographic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Graded exercise testing was performed.
Results
Systematic and random differences (mean Â± SD) of velocity mapping and Doppler tricuspid time to peak velocities (peak E: 1 Â± 26 ms, r = 0.43; peak A: 2 Â± 11 ms, r = 0.76), E/A ratios (0.04 Â± 0.5, r = 0.63) and duration of pulmonary regurgitation (20 Â± 35 ms, r = 0.74) were satisfactory. In 6 patients (group I), late diastolic forward pulmonary artery flow was absent; in 13 patients (group II), this flow contributed 1\% to 14\% to right ventricular stroke volume. Significant differences were increased deceleration time (315 Â± 91 vs. 168 Â± 28 ms, p \&lt; 0.001), decreased filling fraction (44 Â± 11 vs. 55 Â± 16\%, p = 0.02) and increased peak early filling rate (378 Â± 124 vs. 286 Â± 112 ml/s, p = 0.018) between control subjects and group I, and increased deceleration time (230 Â± 40, p = 0.03) between control subjects and group II. Pulmonary regurgitation, ventricular size and ejection fraction did not differ significantly between patient groups. Exercise function was diminished with restrictive right ventricular physiology (p \&lt; 0.001, group II vs. control subjects).
Conclusions
Impaired relaxation and restriction to filling affect diastolic right ventricular function in children with repair of tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary regurgitation. Restrictive right ventricular physiology is associated with decreased exercise function.},

PFR was measured in nine normal volunteers in both fasting and postprandial states, using both 2D and cine PC MR techniques. Two-dimensional PC technique was performed with and without breath-hold (BH). Four different patterns of BH (relaxed maximal inspiration, expiration, Valsalva maneuver, and Müller or reversed Valsalva) were used. Cine PC technique was performed without BH. DDI measurement of PFR was done in the fasting state with relaxed inspiration. PFR measurements made by means of PC MR techniques varied, depending on BH method, and were systematically less than those obtained by DDI. PFR measured during inspiration was significantly less than that measured during expiration and other respiratory maneuvers (P {\textless} .03). PFR increased significantly after a meal for PC and Doppler measurements, with a range of mean increases of 24 to 74\%. Two-dimensional PC MR imaging techniques yielded differing measurements of PFR, depending on whether they were done with or without BH, as well as on the pattern of BH. PC mean measures of PFR were consistently less than those of DDI.

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate spatiotemporal parallel imaging with R = 5 in comparison to conventional parallel imaging with R = 2 applied to phase contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This was motivated by the fact that scan times for PC imaging often exceed breath-hold capabilities of patients even with standard parallel imaging using typical reduction factors of R = 2. Materials and Methods: K-t generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) acquisition was validated in phantom measurements and then applied in 10 volunteer and three patient examinations. Due to the higher reduction factor compared to conventional GRAPPA, k-t GRAPPA measurements could be performed during breath-hold with high spatial and temporal resolution. K-t GRAPPA scans were compared to GRAPPA acquired during free-breathing with navigator respiration control. In addition, spatiotemporally accelerated PC imaging was acquired during free-breathing for comparison of k-t-accelerated breath-held scans. Results: Substantial improvements in image quality for the breath-hold measurements were observed. Significantly reduced peak velocities were found for the GRAPPA protocol compared to the k-t-accelerated breath-hold scans for both flow (8\%) and myocardial motion (up to 30\%) measurements. Conclusion: Spatiotemporal acceleration allows the performance of high temporal or spatial resolution PC imaging during breath-hold while providing high image quality and robust acquisition of functional information that cannot be achieved during breath-hold with standard techniques.

Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) has been used to measure coronary arterial flow in animals, but its accuracy in humans is unknown.
Methods and Results Twelve subjects (7 men, 5 women; age, 44 to 67 years) underwent PC-MRI measurements of flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery or one of its diagonal branches at rest and after administration of adenosine (140 μg·kg−1·min−1 IV). Immediately thereafter, intracoronary Doppler velocity (IDV) and flow measurements were made during cardiac catheterization at rest and after intravenous administration of adenosine. For the 12 patients, the correlation between MRI and invasive measurements of coronary arterial flow and coronary arterial flow reserve was excellent: coronary flowMRI (mL/min)= 0.85×coronary flowIDV (mL/min)+17 (mL/min), r=.89, and coronary flow reserveMRI=0.79×coronary velocity reserveIDV+0.34, r=.89. For the range of coronary arterial flows (18 to 161 mL/min) measured by MRI, the limit of agreement between MRI and catheterization measurements of flow was −13±30 mL/min; for the range of coronary reserves (0.7 to 3.7) measured by MRI, the limit of agreement between the two techniques was 0.1±0.4.
Conclusions Cine velocity-encoded PC-MRI can noninvasively measure absolute coronary arterial flow in the left anterior descending artery in humans. PC-MRI can detect pharmacologically induced changes in coronary arterial flow and can reliably distinguish between those subjects with normal and abnormal coronary artery flow reserve.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

Eddy current induced velocity offsets are of concern for accuracy in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) volume flow quantification. However, currently known theoretical aspects of eddy current behavior have not led to effective guidelines for the optimization of flow quantification sequences. This study is aimed at identifying correlations between protocol parameters and the resulting velocity error in clinical CMR flow measurements in a multi-vendor study.


METHODS

Nine 1.5T scanners of three different types/vendors were studied. Measurements were performed on a large stationary phantom. Starting from a clinical breath-hold flow protocol, several protocol parameters were varied. Acquisitions were made in three clinically relevant orientations. Additionally, a time delay between the bipolar gradient and read-out, asymmetric versus symmetric velocity encoding, and gradient amplitude and slew rate were studied in adapted sequences as exploratory measurements beyond the protocol. Image analysis determined the worst-case offset for a typical great-vessel flow measurement.


RESULTS

The results showed a great variation in offset behavior among scanners (standard deviation among samples of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.9 cm/s for the three different scanner types), even for small changes in the protocol. Considering the absolute values, none of the tested protocol settings consistently reduced the velocity offsets below the critical level of 0.6 cm/s neither for all three orientations nor for all three scanner types. Using multilevel linear model analysis, oblique aortic and pulmonary slices showed systematic higher offsets than the transverse aortic slices (oblique aortic 0.6 cm/s, and pulmonary 1.8 cm/s higher than transverse aortic). The exploratory measurements beyond the protocol yielded some new leads for further sequence development towards reduction of velocity offsets; however those protocols were not always compatible with the time-constraints of breath-hold imaging and flow-related artefacts.


CONCLUSIONS

This study showed that with current systems there was no generic protocol which resulted into acceptable flow offset values. Protocol optimization would have to be performed on a per scanner and per protocol basis. Proper optimization might make accurate (transverse) aortic flow quantification possible for most scanners. Pulmonary flow quantification would still need further (offline) correction.},

	abstract = {AIM: The influences on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Displacement ENcoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI of field strength, receiver coil sensitivity and choice of flip angle strategy have been previously investigated individually. In this study, all of these parameters have been investigated in the same setting, and a mutual comparison of their impact on SNR is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were imaged in a 1.5 T and a 3 T MRI system, using standard five- or six-channel cardiac coils as well as 32-channel coils, with four different excitation patterns. Variation of spatial coil sensitivity was assessed by regional SNR analysis. RESULTS: SNR ranging from 2.8 to 30.5 was found depending on the combination of excitation patterns, coil sensitivity and field strength. The SNR at 3 T was 53±26\% higher than at 1.5 T (P{\textless}.001), whereas spatial differences of 59±26\% were found in the ventricle (P{\textless}.001). Thirty-two-channel coils provided 52±29\% higher SNR compared to standard five- or six-channel coils (P{\textless}.001). A fixed flip angle strategy provided an excess of 50\% higher SNR in half of the imaged cardiac cycle compared to a sweeping flip angle strategy, and a single-phase acquisition provided a sixfold increase of SNR compared to a cine acquisition. CONCLUSION: The effect of field strength and receiver coil sensitivity influences the SNR with the same order of magnitude, whereas flip angle strategy can have a larger effect on SNR. Thus, careful choice of imaging hardware in combination with adaptation of the acquisition protocol is crucial in order to realize sufficient SNR in DENSE MRI.},

METHODS AND RESULTS Arteriographically normal coronary angiograms were analyzed from the following groups of subjects: group 1 (age, 15-34 years) consisted of 30 post-cardiac transplant patients with donor hearts from male subjects aged 15-34 years, group 2 (age, 35-54 years) consisted of 12 post-cardiac transplant patients with donor hearts from male subjects aged 35-54 years and 26 male subjects investigated for atypical chest pain, and group 3 (age, 55-74 years) consisted of 26 male subjects investigated for atypical chest pain. All angiograms were performed after sublingual nitroglycerin. Measurements of the dimensions of the left main, proximal left anterior descending, proximal left circumflex, and proximal right coronary arteries were made using a computer-assisted edge-detection algorithm. The regional myocardial mass supplied by each vessel was derived from echocardiographically derived total left ventricular mass and a semiquantitative angiographic territory scoring system based primarily on the number and length of its terminal nutrient branches.
CONCLUSIONS Linear regression analysis showed that coronary vessel cross-sectional area and total coronary cross-sectional area increase with regional myocardial mass and decrease linearly with age. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that regional myocardial mass and age were independent predictors of cross-sectional area for each vessel and for the total coronary cross-sectional area. We speculate that age-related decline in physical activity, in part, may be responsible.},

Each k-space segment is Fourier transformed into an image in which rotational and translational displacements are measured manually. Before correction, k-space is made as Hermitian as allowed by the largest symmetric range of low spatial frequencies acquired with the subject stationary. Segments of k-space acquired with the subject in different positions are corrected separately. Although translation corrections can be applied effectively to both k-space and the spatial domain, rotation corrections are applied in the spatial domain to avoid image artifacts. To complement the correction, data corrupted by rotation are replaced by the complex conjugate of data of the opposite kx, and ky, provided that these data have not been corrupted by rotation. The method reduced ghosts and blurring substantially on sagittal head images acquired with a standard spin-echo pulse sequence while a volunteer subject nodded his head.},

Application of a resonant magnetic field gradient operating at the US frequency permits detection of nanometer motions associated with ultrasound, and allows direct measurement of absolute pressure, intensity, and speed of sound. By altering gradient timing, the propagation of US fields in time and space can be observed; this enables tracking of US scattering phenomena in a tissue-equivalent medium. An experimental apparatus was constructed that combined a 515-kHz focused US transducer configured with its focus in the center of a small-bore oscillating gradient. This provided an oscillating gradient with a peak gradient strength of 0.40 T/m over a useable imaging volume of 61 cm3. When used in conjunction with 1.5-T clinical MRI system, this apparatus allowed the clear visualization of the focused US field within this volume and its propagation with time. Current limits of sensitivity indicate a noise equivalent sensitivity of 3.8 nm in displacement amplitude, 19 kPa in pressure amplitude and 12 mW/cm2 in acoustic intensity. These studies indicate that MRI can provide a new, noninvasive method for US exposimetry and the basic study of ultrasound biophysics in tissue.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the use of a nonrigid registration technique for semi-automatic segmentation of the aorta from real-time velocity mapping MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time phase contrast images were acquired to measure flow and stroke volumes in 10 subjects, during free breathing, at rest, and during exercise. A nonrigid registration algorithm was developed to propagate a manually drawn region of interest in the aorta from one frame to all other frames of the real-time sequence (148 images). Thus the technique provided a semi-automatic segmentation over the whole sequence of images. The accuracy was assessed by comparison with manual segmentations in terms of Dice overlap measures and stroke volumes (SV).
RESULTS: Semi-automatic segmentations were comparable to manual ones (Dice score of 0.89 ± 0.04). Inter-observer reproducibility was similar for manual and semi-automatic segmentations (Dice score of 0.90 ± 0.04 in both cases, the difference was not significant). SV measurements also showed good agreement between manual and semi-automatic segmentations (correlation coefficient r {\textgreater} 0.94), and the differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Although real-time phase contrast images have compromised image quality, a fast and robust segmentation of the aorta was possible using the registration-based technique.},

The critical computational cost inherent to the construction of an atlas is highly reduced by the definition of myocardial velocities under a small displacements hypothesis. The indexes we propose are of notable interest for the assessment of anomalies in cardiac mobility and synchronicity when applied, for instance, to candidate selection for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We built an atlas of normality using 2D ultrasound cardiac sequences from 21 healthy volunteers, to which we compared 14 CRT candidates with left ventricular dyssynchrony (LVDYS). We illustrate the potential of our approach in characterizing septal flash, a specific motion pattern related to LVDYS and recently introduced as a very good predictor of response to CRT.},

The cone-beam geometry of C-arm systems is commonly described with projection matrices. Such matrices provide a continuous framework for analyzing the flow of operations needed to compute backprojection for analytical reconstruction, as well as the combination of forward and backward projections for iterative reconstruction. The proposed rectification technique resamples the original data to planes that are aligned with two of the reconstructed volume main axes, so that the original cone-beam geometry can be replaced by a simpler geometry, where succession of plane magnifications are involved only. Rectification generalizes previous independent results to the cone-beam backprojection of preprocessed data as well as to cone-beam iterative reconstruction. The memory access pattern of simple magnifications provides superior predictability and is, therefore, easier to optimize, independently of the choice of the interpolation technique. Rectification is also shown to provide control over interpolation errors through oversampling, allowing tradeoffs between computation speed and precision to be set. Experimental results are provided for linear and nearest neighbor interpolations, based on simulations, as well as phantom and patient data acquired on a digital C-arm system},

	abstract = {Conventional phase-contrast velocity mapping in the ascending aorta was combined with k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE. Up to 5.3-fold net acceleration was achieved, enabling single breath-hold acquisitions. A standard phase-contrast (PC) sequence with interleaved acquisition of the velocity-encoded segments was modified to collect data in 2 stages, a high-resolution under sampled and a low-resolution fully sampled training stage. In addition, a modification of the k-t reconstruction strategy was tested. This strategy, denoted as "plug-in," incorporates data acquired in the training stage into the final reconstruction for improved data consistency, similar to conventional keyhole. "k-t SENSE plug-in" was found to provide best image quality and most accurate flow quantification. For this strategy, at least 10 training profiles are required to yield accurate stroke volumes (relative deviation {\textless}5\%) and good image quality. In vivo 2D cine velocity mapping was performed in 6 healthy volunteers with 30-32 cardiac phases (spatial resolution 1.3 x 1.3 x 8-10 mm(3), temporal resolution of 18-38 ms), yielding relative stroke volumes of 106 +/- 18\% (mean +/- 2*SD) and 112 +/- 15\% for 3.8 x and 5.3 x net accelerations, respectively. In summary, k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE are promising approaches that permit significant scan-time reduction in PC velocity mapping, thus making high-resolution breath-held flow quantification possible.},

The technique acquires and presents the MRI images to the operator the instant they are acquired. However, besides guiding purposes, like catheter tracking and placement of electrodes during neurosurgery, the diagnostic value of this method is relatively unexplored. Purpose To test an interactive slice-positioning system with respect to real-time MRI reconstruction for imaging of moving anatomical structures on two different scanner brands by using inexpensive computer hardware. Materials and methods The MRI data were sampled using two acquisition schemes: a Cartesian sampling scheme and a radial sampling scheme based on the golden ratio. Four anatomical targets, which exhibit non-periodic movement, were identified and imaged: movement of the gastric ventricle emptying, movement of the small bowels, the articulators of a professional singer and of a 20-week old fetus. Results Informative anatomical images were obtained in different settings of moving targets. The implemented real-time system acquired, reconstructed and displayed MRI images in real time with a high frame rate using inexpensive computer hardware on two standard 1.5 T clinical MRI scanners. Conclusion Our approach verified that when imaging selected moving anatomical targets, with no a priori knowledge of the movement, interactive slice positioning using real-time reconstruction may be a feasible approach for finding the optimal slice position in cases in which a standard 3D volumetric scan is impeded by movement. Future studies are needed to explore its full potential.},

The purpose of this study was to compare ventricular volumes in patients with congenital heart disease measured by using (a) a cardiac gated sequence, (b) a standard real-time sequence, and (c) a radial real-time k-space and time (k-t) sensitivity encoding (SENSE) sequence.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

The local research ethics committee approved this study, and written consent was obtained from all participants. Of 40 patients with congenital heart disease, ventricular volumes were measured by using the three sequences. Global image quality and motion fidelity were scored and compared with a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Image contrast, edge sharpness, and summed perimeters (the total length of the endocardial tracings for a given ventricle at systole and diastole) were quantified and compared by using paired t tests. Ventricular volumes were compared with paired t tests, Bland-Altman analysis, and correlation coefficients.


RESULTS

Global image quality, motion fidelity, image contrast, edge sharpness, and summed perimeters were all greater for radial real-time k-t SENSE imaging compared with standard real-time imaging (P {\textless} .05). However, the gated acquisitions were significantly superior to radial real-time k-t SENSE (P {\textless} .05). For cardiac gated versus radial k-t real-time acquisitions, there was no difference between right ventricular (RV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) (P {\textgreater} .15). There was a small difference in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV) and thus, LV stroke volume and EF (P {\textless} .05). For cardiac gated versus standard real-time acquisitions, both RV and LV EDV and thus, stroke volume and EF were significantly lower (P {\textless} .05).


CONCLUSION

Ventricular volumes and function can be accurately quantified by using radial k-t SENSE real-time imaging.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: To assess global and regional myocardial motion in high temporal detail, respiratory-gated MR phase-contrast measurements with three-directional velocity encoding (venc) were performed in 12 healthy volunteers and two patients with LV hypertrophy in basal, midventricular, and apical locations of the LV with a temporal resolution of 13.8 msec.
RESULTS: The volunteer data revealed details in LV motion patterns that were known only from echocardiography. For all volunteers, characteristic myocardial motion patterns, such as triphasic global diastolic expansion, could be detected with high accuracy. One volunteer underwent an additional echocardiographic measurement in order to corroborate the complex motion features as measured by MRI. Patient examinations revealed substantial changes in diastolic function compared to motion patterns in healthy volunteers.
CONCLUSION: The proposed high-temporal-resolution velocity-mapping technique provides previously undetectable information on LV performance, and is highly promising for the detection of local and global motion abnormalities in patients with disturbed LV performance, such as diastolic dysfunction.},

	abstract = {A multilattice sampling approach is proposed for dynamic MRI with Cartesian trajectories. It relies on the use of sampling patterns composed of several different lattices and exploits an image model where only some parts of the image are dynamic, whereas the rest is assumed static. Given the parameters of such an image model, the methodology followed for the design of a multilattice sampling pattern adapted to the model is described. The multi-lattice approach is compared to single-lattice sampling, as used by traditional acceleration methods such as UNFOLD (UNaliasing by Fourier-Encoding the Overlaps using the temporal Dimension) or k-t BLAST, and random sampling used by modern compressed sensing-based methods. On the considered image model, it allows more flexibility and higher accelerations than lattice sampling and better performance than random sampling. The method is illustrated on a phase-contrast carotid blood velocity mapping MR experiment. Combining the multilattice approach with the KEYHOLE technique allows up to 12× acceleration factors. Simulation and in vivo undersampling results validate the method. Compared to lattice and random sampling, multilattice sampling provides significant gains at high acceleration factors.

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a technique for time-resolved acquisition of phase-sensitive dual-inversion recovery (TRAPD) coronary vessel wall magnetic resonance (MR) images, to investigate the success rate in coronary wall imaging compared with that of single-frame imaging, and to assess vessel wall thickness in healthy subjects and subjects with risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD).
Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight subjects (12 healthy subjects, 26 subjects with at least one CAD risk factor) provided informed consent for participation in this institutional review board–approved and HIPAA-compliant study. The TRAPD coronary vessel wall imaging sequence was developed and validated with a flow phantom. Time-resolved coronary artery wall images at three to five cine phases were obtained in all subjects. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons were made between TRAPD and conventional single-image wall measurements. Measurement reproducibility also was assessed. Statistical analysis was performed for all comparisons.
Results: The TRAPD sequence successfully restored the negative polarity of lumen signal and enhanced lumen wall contrast on the cine images of the flow phantom and in all subjects. Use of three to five frames increased the success rate of acquiring at least one image of good to excellent quality from 76\% in single-image acquisitions to 95\% with the TRAPD sequence. The difference in vessel wall thickness between healthy subjects and subjects with CAD risk factors was significant (P {\textless} .05) with the TRAPD sequence (1.07 vs 1.46 mm, respectively; 36\% increase) compared with single-frame dual inversion-recovery imaging (1.24 vs 1.55 mm, respectively; 25\% increase). Intraobserver, interobserver, and interexamination agreement for wall thickness measurement were 0.98, 0.97, and 0.92, respectively.
Conclusion: TRAPD imaging of coronary arteries improved arterial wall visualization and quantitative assessment by increasing the success rate of obtaining good- to excellent-quality images and sections orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the vessel. This also resulted in vessel wall thickness measurements that show a more distinct difference between healthy subjects and those with CAD risk factors. © RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120068/-/DC1},

The purpose of this work was to evaluate error caused by the use of respiratory ordering of phase encoding in MR cine phase-contrast (CPC) volumetric flow measurements when the flow rate is sensitive to respiration. It was hypothesized that this effect is due to the systematic biasing of a respiratory-induced phase modulation function in k-space. A theoretical model for the effects of respiration was developed and then tested in flow phantom studies and in normal volunteer studies. In phantom experiments, the use of respiratory ordering induced an error of as much as 13\% in CPC volumetric flow measurements. In preliminary volunteer studies, error was as high as 26\% in superior vena cava flow measurements versus less than 1\% error in the ascending aorta. It is concluded that a potential for error exists in CPC volumetric flow measurements obtained with the use of respiratory ordering schemes. Volunteer studies with larger numbers are warranted. Clinical applications in which this effect may be important include flow measurements in vessels subject to variations in flow due to respiration, such as the venae cavae, pulmonary vasculature, and portal vein.},

RESULTS: Excellent correlations in average velocities (r = 0.99, P {\textless} 0.001), peak velocities (r = 0.99, P {\textless} 0.001), and flow rates (r = 0.98, P {\textless} 0.001) were demonstrated in vitro between the two different acquisitions. For the popliteal arteries there was excellent correlation between peak velocities for both acquisitions (r = 0.98, P {\textless} 0.0001); the correlation of average velocity measurements when using all data points in the cardiac cycle for all volunteers was 0.96 (P {\textless} 0.001).

To discuss differences between displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) and the harmonic phase (HARP) in imaging and reconstruction strategies.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

HARP and DENSE are presented in their historical context: while the HARP method was developed from the framework of myocardial tagging, DENSE arose from the framework of stimulated echo and displacement encoding using bipolar gradients. Both techniques have evolved since their introduction, thereby becoming more similar over time and losing their distinct features. Newly introduced improvements have successfully been applied in both methods. Differences between both methods are discussed point by point.


RESULTS

From this discussion it follows that almost all apparent differences are in fact nonexistent.


CONCLUSION

In the literature, both techniques are still regarded as distinctly different techniques, where a more general treatment of the technique is justified. Once it is realized that both frameworks are easily merged, the benefits are 1) less confusion about the (dis)advantages of either technique, and 2) understanding of phase-based strain imaging that is more general than HARP or DENSE alone.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of breathing on image quality of the aortic arch and carotid vessels during contrast-enhanced MR angiography and to show that high-resolution breath-hold contrast-enhanced MR angiography combined with a timing-bolus technique can produce high-quality images of the entire carotid circulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty patients underwent high-resolution contrast-enhanced MR angiography on a 1.5-T Magnetom Symphony. A coronal three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo sequence (TR/TE, 4.36/1.64; flip angle, 25°) with asymmetric k-space acquisition was used. The 136 × 512 matrix yielded voxel sizes of 1.33 × 0.64 × 1.0 mm. A timing-bolus acquisition, orientated in the coronal plane to include the aortic arch, was obtained initially during free-breathing. Twenty milliliters of gadopenetate dimeglumine was injected at 2 mL/sec. Unenhanced and enhanced 3D volumes were recorded. A subtracted 3D set was calculated and subjected to a maximum-intensity-projection algorithm. Half of the patients held their breath during angiography and the other half did not. Aortic arch motion was measured on the timing-bolus acquisition as the distance moved by a single pixel in both the x and y directions. Maximum-intensity-projection MR images were assessed independently by two observers, and vessel sharpness was scored on a scale of 1-5. Sharpness was also assessed quantitatively by generating a signal intensity profile across the aortic arch vessel wall and calculating the average of the upslope and downslope at full-width half maximum. Visualization of carotid branch vessels was scored on a scale of 0-5, and venous contamination was scored on a scale of 0-3.
RESULTS. Average in-plane aortic arch movement was 10.3 mm in the x direction and 8.7 mm in the y direction. Quantitative and qualitative sharpness of the aortic arch and great vessel origins was better (p {\textless} 0.05) during breath-holding than during non—breath-holding. No difference in the sharpness of the carotid vessels was noted between the two groups. Carotid branch vessels were well visualized from the aortic arch to the intracerebral circulation. The average venous contamination score was 0.56.
CONCLUSION. Breath-holding greatly improves the sharpness of the aortic arch and great vessel origins but has no effect on visualization of the carotid vessels. High-resolution breath-hold contrast-enhanced MR angiography can produce high-quality, artifact-free images of the entire carotid circulation from the aortic arch to the intracerebral circulation.},

The required final z-magnetization vector (Mz) is expressed as a function of the off-resonance frequency as an Nth order complex Fourier series. We then form a consistent Fourier series for (Mxy). As many as 2(2)N different pulse sequences may be directly generated all of which produce a different Mxy(f), but the same Mz(f). A pulse sequence is then generated which will yield the desired Mz(f) and Mxy(f). This is done by an analytic inversion of the Bloch equation, not by the classical Fourier approximation.

	abstract = {Two-dimensional spatially-selective RF (2DRF) excitation pulses were developed for single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) with reduced field of view (FOV) in the phase-encoding direction. The decreased number of k-space lines significantly shortens the length of the EPI echo train. Thus, both gradient-echo and spin-echo 2DRF-EPI images of the human brain at 2.0 T exhibit markedly reduced susceptibility artifacts in regions close to major air cavities. Based on a blipped-planar trajectory, implementation of a typical 2DRF pulse resulted in a 26-ms pulse duration, a 5-mm section thickness, a 40-mm FOV along the phase-encoding direction, and a 200-mm distance of the unavoidable side excitations from the center of the FOV. For the above conditions and at 2 × 2 mm2 resolution, 2DRF-EPI yielded an echo train length of only 21 ms, as opposed to 102 ms for conventional EPI. This gain in time may be used to achieve higher spatial resolution. For example, spin-echo 2DRF-EPI of a 40-mm FOV at 1 × 1 mm2 resolution led to an echo train of 66 ms. Although the current implementation still lacks user-friendliness, 2DRF pulses are likely to become a useful addition to the arsenal of advanced MRI tools.

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To design a segmented inversion-recovery turbo fast low-angle shot (turboFLASH) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging pulse sequence for the visualization of myocardial infarction, compare this technique with other MR imaging approaches in a canine model of ischemic injury, and evaluate its utility in patients with coronary artery disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Six dogs and 18 patients were examined. In dogs, infarction was produced and images were acquired by using 10 different pulse sequences. In patients, the segmented turboFLASH technique was used to acquire contrast material-enhanced images 19 days +/- 7 (SD) after myocardial infarction.


RESULTS

Myocardial regions of increased signal intensity were observed in all animals and patients at imaging. With the postcontrast segmented turboFLASH sequence, the signal intensity of the infarcted myocardium was 1,080\% +/- 214 higher than that of the normal myocardium in dogs-nearly twice that of the next best sequence tested and approximately 10-fold greater than that in previous reports. All 18 patients with myocardial infarction demonstrated high signal intensity at imaging. On average, the signal intensity of the high-signal-intensity regions in patients was 485\% +/- 43 higher than that of the normal myocardium.


CONCLUSION

The segmented inversion-recovery turboFLASH sequence produced the greatest differences in regional myocardial signal intensity in animals. Application of this technique in patients with infarction substantially improved differentiation between injured and normal regions.},

In the field of medical imaging, a variety of techniques primarily based on the principle of Fourier encoding have been described. Due to time constraints, necessary trade-offs exist between spatial versus velocity spectral resolution. In general, either the average velocity of individual pixels is displayed or velocity spectral determinations are made at the cost of spatial localization. The recent development of multidimensional excitation pulses makes spatial localization possible during the excitation phase of the pulse sequences. This approach, coupled with time varying gradient readout, can be used to obtain single-shot localized velocity spectra. Using these concepts, we have obtained in vivo real-time measurements of localized velocity spectra on our clinical imager.},

Two pulse sequence types are used for sensitivity to flow in one direction, whereas four are needed for sensitivity in all directions. Several alternatives for synchronization of the data to the cardiac cycle exist. Retrospectively interpolated methods can image the entire cardiac cycle efficiently. Rapid interleaving of the various sequence types ensures immunity to motion misregistration. The technique produces images in which contrast is related to flow velocity as well as magnitude images such as those of conventional cine MRI. The data can be interpreted qualitatively to demonstrate the presence, magnitude, and direction of flow, and quantitatively to provide estimates of flow velocity, volume flow rate, and displaced volumes. Phase contrast cine MRI is helpful in the diagnosis of aortic dissections, in the study of flow distributions in large vessels such as pulmonary arteries, as well as in smaller vessels such as carotid and basilar arteries, and in the evaluation of complex anatomical variants. Future developments are expected to reduce imaging time and expand the quantitative applications.},

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints, however, limit image quality and blood myocardium delineation, which crucially depend on high spatial resolution. Significant gains in SNR with a cryogenically cooled RF probe have been shown for mouse brain MRI, yet the potential of applying cryogenic RF coils for cardiac MR (CMR) in mice is, as of yet, untapped. This study examines the feasibility and potential benefits of CMR in mice employing a 400 MHz cryogenic RF surface coil, compared with a conventional mouse heart coil array operating at room temperature. The cryogenic RF coil affords SNR gains of 3.0 to 5.0 versus the conventional approach and hence enables an enhanced spatial resolution. This markedly improved image quality – by better deliniation of myocardial borders and enhanced depiction of papillary muscles and trabeculae – and facilitated a more accurate cardiac chamber quantification, due to reduced intraobserver variability. In summary the use of a cryogenically cooled RF probe represents a valuable means of enhancing the capabilities of CMR of mice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Despite the large availability of 3T MR scanners and the potential of high field imaging, this technical platform has yet to prove its usefulness in the cardiac MR setting, where 1.5T remains the established standard. Global perfusion of the left ventricle, as well as the coronary flow reserve (CFR), can provide relevant diagnostic information, and MR measurements of these parameters may benefit from increased field strength. Quantitative flow measurements in the coronary sinus (CS) provide one method to investigate these parameters. However, the ability of newly developed faster MR sequences to measure coronary flow during a breath-hold at 3T has not been evaluated.


METHODS

The aim of this work was to measure CS flow using segmented phase contrast MR (PC MR) on a clinical 3T MR scanner. Parallel imaging was employed to reduce the total acquisition time. Global LV perfusion was calculated by dividing CS flow with left ventricular (LV) mass. The repeatability of the method was investigated by measuring the flow three times in each of the twelve volunteers. Phantom experiments were performed to investigate potential error sources.


RESULTS

The average CS flow was determined to 88 +/- 33 ml/min and the deduced LV perfusion was 0.60 +/- 0.22 ml/min.g, in agreement with published values. The repeatability (1-error) of the three repeated measurements in each subject was on average 84\%.


CONCLUSION

This work demonstrates that the combination of high field strength (3T), parallel imaging and segmented gradient echo sequences allow for quantification of the CS flow and global perfusion within a breath-hold.},

	abstract = {The need for ECG gating presents many difficulties in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). Real-time imaging techniques eliminate the need for ECG gating in cine CMRI, but they cannot offer the spatial and temporal resolution provided by segmented acquisition techniques. Previous MR signal-based techniques have demonstrated an ability to provide cardiac gating information; however, these techniques result in decreased imaging efficiency. The purpose of this work was to develop a new “self-gated” (SG) acquisition technique that eliminates these efficiency deficits by extracting the motion synchronization signal directly from the same MR signals used for image reconstruction. Three separate strategies are proposed for deriving the SG signal from data acquired using radial k-space sampling: echo peak magnitude, kymogram, and 2D correlation. The SG techniques were performed on seven normal volunteers. A comparison of the results showed that they provided cine image series with no significant differences in image quality compared to that obtained with conventional ECG gating techniques. SG techniques represent an important practical advance in clinical MRI because they enable the acquisition of high temporal and spatial resolution cardiac cine images without the need for ECG gating and with no loss in imaging efficiency.

Dedicated CS sampling schemes applied prospectively to normal mouse hearts yielded comparable left-ventricular functional parameters, and intra- and interobserver variability between fully and 3-fold undersampled data.Conclusion:This study introduces and validates an alternative means to speed up experimental cine-MRI without the need for expensive hardware.

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To compare generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA), modified sensitivity encoding (mSENSE), and SENSE in phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) applications.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Aliasing of the torso can occur in PC-MRI applications. If the data are further undersampled for parallel imaging, SENSE can be problematic in correctly unaliasing signals due to coil sensitivity maps that do not match that of the aliased volume. Here, a method for estimating coil sensitivities in flow applications is described. Normal volunteers (n = 5) were scanned on a 1.5 T MRI scanner and underwent PC-MRI scans using GRAPPA, mSENSE, SENSE, and conventional PC-MRI acquisitions. Peak velocity and flow through the aorta and pulmonary artery were evaluated.


RESULTS

Bland-Altman statistics for flow in the aorta and pulmonary artery acquired with mSENSE and GRAPPA methods (R = 2 and R = 3 cases) have comparable mean differences to flow acquired with conventional PC-MRI. GRAPPA and mSENSE PC-MRI have more robust measurements than SENSE when there is aliasing artifact caused by insufficient coil sensitivity maps. For peak velocity, there are no considerable differences among the mSENSE, GRAPPA, and SENSE reconstructions and are comparable to conventional PC-MRI.


CONCLUSION

Flow measurements of images reconstructed with autocalibration techniques have comparable agreement with conventional PC-MRI and provide robust measurements in the presence of wraparound.},

	abstract = {Physiologic motion of the heart is one of the major problems of myocardial blood flow quantification using first pass perfusion-MRI method. To overcome these problems, a perfusion pulse sequence with prospective slice tracking was developed. Cardiac motion was monitored by a navigator directly positioned at heart's basis to overcome no additional underlying model calculations connecting diaphragm and cardiac motion. Additional prescans were used before the perfusion measurement to detect slice displacements caused by remaining cardiac motion between navigator and the perfusion slice readout. The pulse sequence and subsequent quantification of myocardial blood flow was tested in healthy pigs with and without prospective slice tracking under both free-breathing and breath-hold conditions. To avoid influences by residual contrast agent concentration time courses were analyzed. Median myocardial blood flow values and interquartile ranges with prospective slice tracking under free-breathing and in a breath-hold were (1.04, interquartile range = 0.58 mL/min/g) and (1.20, interquartile range = 0.59 mL/min/g), respectively. This is in agreement with published positron emission tomography values. In measurements without prospective slice tracking (1.15, interquartile range = 1.58 mL/min/g), the interquartile range is significantly (P {\textless} 0.012) larger because of residual cardiac motion. In conclusion, prospective slice tracking reduces motion-induced variations of myocardial blood flow under both during breath-hold and under conditions of free-breathing.},

Given its successful application on micro- and animal MRI systems, the purpose of this work is to enable and demonstrate ZTE imaging in humans using a whole-body magnet. Methods A commercial 7 T MRI scanner was complemented by rapid high-power transmit-receive switches, a custom-built spectrometer, and a proton-free detector coil. With this setup, transmit-receive switching is achieved within 1 µs, radiofrequency (RF) excitation is performed in 3 µs, and digital bandpass filtering takes 5.3 µs, resulting in an effective dead time of only 5 µs. Results ZTE imaging was performed at 250 and 500 kHz bandwidth with central k-space gaps of 1.2 and 2.5 Nyquist intervals and repetition times of 739 and 471 µs. The technique was applied for silent 3D imaging of the head and joints of human volunteers at an isotropic resolution down to 0.83 mm. A sound pressure level of 41 dB(A) was measured, which is a reduction of more than 40 dB(A) compared to gradient-switched MRI.

	abstract = {L'Imagerie par Résonance Magnétique (IRM) présente deux caractéristiques principales. La première, sa capacité à manipuler le contraste, constitue son principal avantage par rapport aux autres modalités d'imagerie. Cela permet d'obtenir des informations complémentaires pour une meilleure détectabilité et une meilleure précision dans le diagnostic. Cela est particulièrement appréciable pour les pathologies du myocarde. La seconde caractéristique de l'IRM est également l'un de ces principaux inconvénients : le processus d'acquisition est relativement lent. De ce fait, les mouvements du patient constituent un obstacle important puisqu'ils perturbent ce processus d'acquisition, ce qui se traduit par des artéfacts dans l'image reconstruite. L'imagerie cardiaque et abdominale sont donc particulièrement sensibles à cette problématique du mouvement. L'objectif de cette thèse est donc de proposer une méthode de correction de mouvement intégrable dans un contexte multi-contraste. Nous avons étudié dans un premier temps la question de la correction de mouvement seule. Pour cela, nous nous sommes plus particulièrement intéressés à la méthode GRICS déjà développée au laboratoire IADI. Cette méthode permet la reconstruction conjointe d'une image sans artéfact et d'un modèle de mouvement non rigide permettant de corriger les déplacements qui surviennent pendant l'acquisition. Le premier apport majeur de cette thèse a consisté à améliorer la méthode GRICS, notamment pour l'adapter à l'imagerie volumique 3D. Il s'agit d'une nouvelle méthode de régularisation adaptative particulièrement adaptée au problème inverse posé dans GRICS. Le second apport majeur de cette thèse a consisté à gérer la correction de mouvement GRICS de manière conjointe sur des acquisitions présentant des contrastes différents. Il s'agit de concevoir l'examen IRM comme un tout et d'exploiter au mieux les informations partagées entre les différents contrastes. Toutes ces méthodes ont été appliquées et validées par des simulations, des tests sur fantôme, sur volontaires sains et sur des patients dans la cadre d'études cliniques. L'application cardiaque a été particulièrement visée. Les méthodes développées ont permis d'améliorer le processus d'acquisition et de reconstruction dans le contexte clinique réel},

We validated our methods by comparing the quantitative analysis results of RT MCE using our methods with those using Lucas \& Kanade's optical flow technique, which had been report to be accurate enough for this ROI tracking.

	abstract = {Partial Fourier MR images (PFI) are constructed from data that have fewer phase encoding views than are conventionally acquired using direct Fourier transform spin echo acquisition. The PFI data acquisition is structured to obtain the same spatial resolution as conventional acquisition, trading off signal-to-noise reduction for acquisition time improvement. The “missing” views can be zero filled or, if the data are Hermitian, supplied by symmetry (basic algorithm). The effect of spatially dependent phase shifts (SDPS) on PFI constructed with zero-fill or the basic algorithm is illustrated. The causes and typical magnitudes of such SDPS are discussed. In spin echo data only the low order, slowly varying SDPS, is shown to be significant. Through use of simulated and actual data sets these typical SDPS are shown to produce significant artifacts in PFI, when the amount of missing data is close to one-half. The artifacts are reduced when less data are missing. Good images can be generated with the zero-fill algorithm if less than 25\% of the data is missing. Several methods of correcting phase shifts in PFI are developed: the basic Hermitian algorithm with frequency (x) direction correction (BAX), basic Fourier correction algorithm (BFC) and an improved iterative Fourier correction algorithm (IFC). The BFC and IFC can produce good images when as much as 46\% of the data is missing. Data with rapidly varying SDPS, for example, gradient refocused data, make the phase correction task more difficult. With less than 25\% of the data missing, however, accetable gradient refocused PFI images can be created.},

The respiratory effects on septal position and configuration during early ventricular filling were visually assessed. Results were compared with the short-axis breath-hold cine MRI studies, obtained at end-inspiration. In CP patients, onset of inspiration led to a leftward inversion in four of six patients and flattening of the septum in two of six patients during early ventricular filling. Septal abnormalities progressively disappeared during the following heartbeats. A similar pattern was found in one of six patients with pericardial effusion. The above pattern was absent in RCM patients. Although septal flattening during early inspiration was also found in two of six normal volunteers, flattening was minimal compared to that in CP patients. In all cor pulmonale patients, septal flattening or inversion was present, but this was not influenced by respiratory motion. Real-time cine MRI is a promising technique for determining the influence of respiration on septal motion and might be helpful in differentiating between different causes of impaired ventricular filling.},

Full in-plane velocity information of the moving heart was obtained in 16 heartbeats within one breath-hold measurement. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers (mean age=25 years) were examined with both imaging modalities. Both PCMRI and TDI demonstrate a biphasic profile of radial velocities over the cardiac cycle. Intraindividual comparison of left ventricular velocity data acquired using PCMRI and TDI show a very good correspondence with r-values of 0.97.

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki; each subject provided informed written consent. Ninety-six healthy volunteers (57 [59\%] men, 39 [41\%] women; mean age, 38 years ± 12 [standard deviation]) underwent cardiac phase-contrast imaging with a black blood segmented k-space gradient-echo sequence for the analysis of three-dimensional myocardial velocity with high spatial resolution at 1.5 T on basal, midventricular, and apical short-axis views. Eighteen consecutive volunteers were imaged twice to determine interstudy reproducibility, and intra- and interobserver variability values were analyzed. Systolic and diastolic velocity curves were analyzed for peak velocity and time to peak velocity in the radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions, as well as for torsion rate and longitudinal strain rate. Mixed-effects models with a random intercept for volunteers were used to test differences among the three ventricular sections and the transmural, endocardial, and epicardial parameters.
Results: TPM enabled reproducible assessment of myocardial velocity with small intra- and interobserver variability values. Systolic peak radial velocity was lowest at the apical level (P {\textless} .001); diastolic peak radial velocity was similar at all three myocardial levels (P = .73). As viewed from the apex, a relative counterclockwise rotation during systole was followed by a relative clockwise rotation of the apex against the base. Diastolic and systolic peak longitudinal velocity values decreased from base to apex (P {\textless} .001). A gradient between endocardium and epicardium was observed for radial velocity values, with greater endocardial velocity values (P {\textless} .001).
Conclusion: TPM is a reproducible comprehensive modality for assessment of regional wall motion, and intra- and interobserver variability values are low.

	abstract = {SiMultaneous Acquisition of Spatial Harmonics (SMASH) is a new fast-imaging technique that increases MR image acquisition speed by an integer factor over existing fast-imaging methods, without significant sacrifices in spatial resolution or signal-to-noise ratio. Image acquisition time is reduced by exploiting spatial information inherent in the geometry of a surface coil array to substitute for some of the phase encoding usually produced by magnetic field gradients. This allows for partially parallel image acquisitions using many of the existing fast-imaging sequences. Unlike the data combination algorithms of prior proposals for parallel imaging, SMASH reconstruction involves a small set of MR signal combinations prior to Fourier transformation, which can be advantageous for artifact handling and practical implementation. A twofold savings in image acquisition time is demonstrated here using commercial phased array coils on two different MR-imaging systems. Larger time savings factors can be expected for appropriate coil designs.},

	abstract = {The idea of using parallel imaging to shorten the acquisition time by the simultaneous use of multiple receive coils can be adapted for the parallel transmission of a spatially-selective multidimensional RF pulse. As in data acquisition, a multidimensional RF pulse follows a certain k-space trajectory. Shortening this trajectory shortens the pulse duration. The use of multiple transmit coils, each with its own time-dependent waveform and spatial sensitivity, can compensate for the missing parts of the excitation k-space. This results in a maintained spatial definition of the pulse profile, while its duration is reduced. This work introduces the concept of parallel transmission with arbitrarily shaped transmit coils (termed “Transmit SENSE”). Results of numerical studies demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of the approach. The experimental proof of principle is provided on a commercial MR scanner. The lack of multiple independent transmit channels was addressed by combining the excitation patterns from two separate subexperiments with different transmit setups. Shortening multidimensional RF pulses could be an interesting means of making 3D RF pulses feasible even for fast T relaxing species or strong main field inhomogeneities. Other applications might benefit from the ability of Transmit SENSE to improve the spatial resolution of the pulse profile while maintaining the transmit duration.

	abstract = {Real-time imaging may be clinically important in patients with congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, or in pediatric cases. However, real-time imaging typically has compromised spatial and temporal resolution compared with gated, segmented studies. To combine the best features of both types of imaging, a new method is proposed that uses parallel imaging to improve temporal resolution of real-time acquired images at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but then produces an SNR-enhanced cine by means of respiratory motion-corrected averaging of images acquired in real-time over multiple heartbeats while free-breathing. The retrospective processing based on image-based navigators and nonrigid image registration is fully automated. The proposed method was compared with conventional cine images in 21 subjects. The resultant image quality for the proposed method (3.9 ± 0.44) was comparable to the conventional cine (4.2 ± 0.99) on a 5-point scale (P = not significant [n.s.]). The conventional method exhibited degraded image quality in cases of arrhythmias whereas the proposed method had uniformly good quality. Motion-corrected averaging of real-time acquired cardiac images provides a means of attaining high-quality cine images with many of the benefits of real-time imaging, such as free-breathing acquisition and tolerance to arrhythmias.

In the generalized SMASH approach described here, coil sensitivity profiles are represented directly in the Fourier domain to provide a general description of the spatial properties of the coils. This removes restrictions imposed by conventional SMASH, so that the choice and position of the receiver coils can be made on the basis of sensitivity to the volume of interest rather than suitability for constructing spatial harmonics. Generalized SMASH also intrinsically allows the freedom to accommodate acquisitions with uniform or nonuniform k-space sampling. The proposed method places SMASH on an equal footing with other parallel imaging techniques (SENSE and SPACE-RIP), while combining strengths from each.

High resolution imaging can be confined to just those areas where it is necessary to resolve strong edges without truncation artifact. Such locally focused images can be acquired in less scan time than that required to image the entire FOV with uniformly high resolution. Images are reconstructed from a subset of the usual phase-encoded signals required to create a uniformly well-resolved image. The measured signals are usually nonuniformly scattered in k-space. Functional and interventional imaging may benefit from this technique, which makes it possible to acquire a rapid series of dynamical images that have high resolution in areas of expected change and lower resolution elsewhere. Spectroscopic images may be improved by using high resolution in the neighborhood of sharp edges (e.g., scalp lipids) that might otherwise cause truncation artifacts.},

It is based on a RR interval prediction algorithm and on a cardiac cycle model. The proposed method was applied to 14 healthy volunteers and is compared to a simple alternative method using a fixed delay and to the standard black blood imaging method for imaging in the mid-diastolic rest period. Results show that the proposed method offers an increased robustness in terms of trigger delay error and image quality compared to the tested simple alternative. Also, it has been shown by qualitative analysis done by an experienced observer that the right ventricle, especially the thin right ventricle free wall, is better depicted with our method than with the standard mid-diastolic rest acquisition.},

	abstract = {Data acquisition for phase contrast velocity mapping of myocardial motion is typically based on multiple breath-held 2D measurements with limited acquisition duration and consequently relatively poor temporal resolution. In order to overcome the limitations of breath-hold acquisitions, an improved navigator-guided technique was implemented based on 2 navigator signals within each cardiac cycle in combination with paired acceptance and rejection criteria of successive navigator signals. Respiratory gated phase contrast measurements with 3-directional velocity encoding were performed in 12 healthy volunteers in basal, midventricular, and apical locations of the left ventricle during free breathing with a temporal resolution of 13.8 ms. Results were compared to standard breath-hold measurements with a temporal resolution of 69 ms. Data from the high temporal resolution study revealed details in left ventricular motion patterns that were previously not seen in phase contrast measurements and are only known from echocardiography. The proposed navigator gated technique for high temporal resolution velocity mapping is, therefore, highly promising for the detection of local and global motion abnormalities in patients with disturbed left ventricular performance, such as diastolic dysfunction.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate in real-time, the effects of respiration in ventricular septal motion and configuration in normal volunteers and cardiac patients. Real-time cine MRI studies, using the steady-state free precession (SSFP) technique, were performed in the cardiac short-axis during operator-guided deep inspiration and expiration in normal volunteers (N = 6), and in patients with constrictive pericarditis (CP; N = 6), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM; N = 4), chronic cor pulmonale (N = 5), and pericardial effusion. The respiratory effects on septal position and configuration during early ventricular filling were visually assessed. Results were compared with the short-axis breath-hold cine MRI studies, obtained at end-inspiration. In CP patients, onset of inspiration led to a leftward inversion in four of six patients and flattening of the septum in two of six patients during early ventricular filling. Septal abnormalities progressively disappeared during the following heartbeats. A similar pattern was found in one of six patients with pericardial effusion. The above pattern was absent in RCM patients. Although septal flattening during early inspiration was also found in two of six normal volunteers, flattening was minimal compared to that in CP patients. In all cor pulmonale patients, septal flattening or inversion was present, but this was not influenced by respiratory motion. Real-time cine MRI is a promising technique for determining the influence of respiration on septal motion and might be helpful in differentiating between different causes of impaired ventricular filling.

	abstract = {Measurement of cardiac function is often performed in mice after, for example, a myocardial infarction. Cardiac MRI is often used because it is noninvasive and provides high temporal and spatial resolution for the left and right ventricle. In animal cardiac MRI, the quality of the required electrocardiogram signal is variable and sometimes deteriorates over time, especially with infarcted hearts or cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we compared the self-gated IntraGateFLASH method with a prospectively triggered FLASH (fast low-angle shot) method in mice with myocardial infarcts (n = 16) and in control mice (n = 21). Mice with a myocardial infarct and control mice were imaged in a vertical 9.4-T MR system. Images of contiguous 1-mm slices were acquired from apex to base with prospective and self-gated methods. Data were processed to calculate cardiac function parameters for the left and right ventricle. The signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were calculated in mid-ventricular slices. The signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios of the self-gated data were higher than those of the prospectively gated data. Differences between the two gating methods in the cardiac function parameters for both left and right ventricle (e.g. end-diastolic volumes) did not exceed the inter-observer variability in control or myocardial infarcted mice. Both methods gave comparable results with regard to the cardiac function parameters in both healthy control mice and mice with myocardial infarcts. Moreover, the self-gated method provided better signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios when the acquisition time was equal. In conclusion, the self-gated method is suitable for routine use in cardiac MRI in mice with myocardial infarcts as well as in control mice, and obviates the need for electrocardiogram triggering and respiratory gating. In both gating methods, more than 10 frames per cardiac cycle are recommended. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To be able to compare results from studies using different methods, and explain possible differences, it is important to know the agreement between these methods. As both self-gated high-field MRI and high-frequency echocardiography (hf-echo) M-mode are potential methods for evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function in healthy mice, our aim was to assess the agreement between these two methods. Fifteen healthy female C57BL/6J mice underwent both self-gated MRI and hf-echo during the same session of light isoflurane anaesthesia. LV dimensions were estimated offline, and agreement between the methods and reproducibility for the two methods assessed using Bland–Altman methods. In summary, hf-echo M-mode had better inter-observer repeatability than self-gated MRI for all measured parameters. Compared with hf-echo, systolic posterior wall thicknesses were significantly higher when measured by MRI, while diastolic anterior wall thicknesses were found to be significantly smaller. MRI measurements of diastolic LV diameter were also higher using MRI, resulting in larger fractional shortening values compared with the values obtained by hf-echo. In conclusion, hf-echo M-mode is easy to apply, has high temporal and spatial resolution, and good reproducibility. Self-gated MRI might be advantageous in cases of abnormal LV geometry and heterogeneous regional myocardial function, especially with improvements in spatial resolution. The moderate agreement between the methods must be taken into account when comparing studies using the two modalities.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish prospectively a database of normal three-dimensional systolic and diastolic endocardial and epicardial velocity values for all myocardial segments in healthy volunteers by using cine phase-contrast velocity magnetic resonance imaging, also called tissue phase mapping (TPM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki; each subject provided informed written consent. Ninety-six healthy volunteers (57 [59\%] men, 39 [41\%] women; mean age, 38 years +/- 12 [standard deviation]) underwent cardiac phase-contrast imaging with a black blood segmented k-space gradient-echo sequence for the analysis of three-dimensional myocardial velocity with high spatial resolution at 1.5 T on basal, midventricular, and apical short-axis views. Eighteen consecutive volunteers were imaged twice to determine interstudy reproducibility, and intra- and interobserver variability values were analyzed. Systolic and diastolic velocity curves were analyzed for peak velocity and time to peak velocity in the radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions, as well as for torsion rate and longitudinal strain rate. Mixed-effects models with a random intercept for volunteers were used to test differences among the three ventricular sections and the transmural, endocardial, and epicardial parameters.
RESULTS: TPM enabled reproducible assessment of myocardial velocity with small intra- and interobserver variability values. Systolic peak radial velocity was lowest at the apical level (P {\textless} .001); diastolic peak radial velocity was similar at all three myocardial levels (P = .73). As viewed from the apex, a relative counterclockwise rotation during systole was followed by a relative clockwise rotation of the apex against the base. Diastolic and systolic peak longitudinal velocity values decreased from base to apex (P {\textless} .001). A gradient between endocardium and epicardium was observed for radial velocity values, with greater endocardial velocity values (P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSION: TPM is a reproducible comprehensive modality for assessment of regional wall motion, and intra- and interobserver variability values are low.},

From the relative time difference of blood flow activity and the slice distance, pulsewave velocities were calculated. With a time resolution of 13 ms an overall acquisition time of 3.3 s was achieved. A method for suppression of signal contributions from stationary tissue along the axis of projection is discussed on the basis of a simplified mathematical model.

	abstract = {MR scans are sensitive to motion effects due to the scan duration. To properly suppress artifacts from nonrigid body motion, complex models with elements such as translation, rotation, shear, and scaling have been incorporated into the reconstruction pipeline. However, these techniques are computationally intensive and difficult to implement for online reconstruction. On a sufficiently small spatial scale, the different types of motion can be well approximated as simple linear translations. This formulation allows for a practical autofocusing algorithm that locally minimizes a given motion metric - more specifically, the proposed localized gradient-entropy metric. To reduce the vast search space for an optimal solution, possible motion paths are limited to the motion measured from multichannel navigator data. The novel navigation strategy is based on the so-called "Butterfly" navigators, which are modifications of the spin-warp sequence that provides intrinsic translational motion information with negligible overhead. With a 32-channel abdominal coil, sufficient number of motion measurements were found to approximate possible linear motion paths for every image voxel. The correction scheme was applied to free-breathing abdominal patient studies. In these scans, a reduction in artifacts from complex, nonrigid motion was observed.

Common errors in phase-contrast imaging include mismatched encoding velocity, deviation of the imaging plane, inadequate temporal resolution, inadequate spatial resolution, accelerated flow and spatial misregistration, and phase offset errors. Flow measurements are most precise if the imaging plane is perpendicular to the vessel of interest and flow encoding is set to through-plane flow. The sequence should be repeated at least once, with a high encoding velocity used initially. If peak velocity has to be estimated, flow measurement is repeated with an adapted encoding velocity. The overall error of a phase-contrast flow measurement comprises errors during prescription as well as errors that occur during image analysis of the flow data. With phase-contrast imaging, the overall error in flow measurement can be reduced to less than 10\%, an acceptable level of error for routine clinical use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

It has been shown that the ratio of systolic duration to diastolic duration (S/D) is a valuable global index of ventricular dysfunction in pediatric dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy and is also a valuable index of the ventricular function of single systemic right ventricles in children who have undergone palliation of hypoplastic left-heart syndrome. The purposes of this study were to establish normal values for the S/D ratio in children without heart disease and to investigate its variation with heart rate (HR), age, and body surface area.


METHODS

Of 752 children found to have functional murmurs by clinical means, 179 (24\% of the total database) had trace holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation. These patients ranged in age from 0.02 months to 19 years. For this study, the diastolic interval was defined as the period of right ventricular filling (ie, the period between 2 tricuspid regurgitant jets) and the systolic interval as the remainder of the cardiac cycle corresponding to the duration of holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation, including the periods of isovolumic contraction and relaxation. The relations between the systolic and diastolic periods and their ratio (S/D ratio) and HR, age, and body surface area were evaluated using univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis.


RESULTS

Patient's age ranged from 0.02 months to 19 years (mean, 70.18+/-65.12 months), body surface area from 0.11 to 2.51 m2 (mean, 0.85+/-0.55 m2), and HR from 50 to 156 beats/min (mean, 96.72+/-23.19 beats/min). The systolic period ranged from 208.5 to 467 ms (mean, 314.08+/-52.57 ms) and the diastolic period from 166.5 to 809 ms (mean, 341.34+/-129.61 ms), yielding a S/D ratio ranging from 0.397 to 1.62 (mean, 0.995+/-0.23). Systolic period duration showed a linear negative decrease with increasing HR (y=1.9228x+500.05, r=-0.85). Diastolic duration decreased in an exponential fashion as HR increased (y=130,679x(-1.3232), r=-0.88). The S/D ratio correlated positively with HR (y=-1.656+0.0265 HR-0.000954 HR2, r=76). On multivariate analysis, no significant correlations of S/D ratio with age or body surface area were found.


CONCLUSIONS

The results of this study provide useful reference values for the S/D ratio across a wide range of HRs in children, adolescents, and young adults.},

To compare accelerated real-time two-dimensional (2D) and segmented three-dimensional (3D) cine steady-state free precession magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques by using a 32-channel coil with a conventional 2D cine imaging approach for imaging the heart and to evaluate any difference caused by free breathing and breath holding for real-time imaging.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant study, 10 healthy volunteers and 22 consecutive patients who were suspected of having or were known to have heart disease underwent cardiac MR imaging by using a 32-channel coil. A conventional multisection 2D real-time cine sequence was used as the reference standard, and three additional accelerated cine sequences were implemented. Volumetric parameters, including ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume(SV), and myocardial mass, were derived. Wall motion and image quality were assessed by two radiologists. In addition, image time was registered. An additional set of images was acquired by using real-time sequences with free breathing, and quantitative measurements were compared with measurements on images obtained with breath holding. For quantitative analysis, repeated-measures analysis of variance, paired t test, and Bland-Altman analysis were used; for qualitative analysis, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used.


RESULTS

All volumetric measurements were significantly correlated with those of the standard sequence (r {\textgreater} 0.80, P {\textless} .01). No significant difference among protocols was observed in terms of mean levels for EF or ESV (P {\textgreater} .05). However, a significant difference was indicated for EDV and SV (P {\textless} .01).The accelerated protocols had significantly shorter image times (P {\textless} .001). Wall motion scores were concordant with the standard sequence in 43-44 (93\%-96\%) segments for the accelerated protocols, with a strong interreader agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, {\textgreater} or =0.93). No significant difference was identified between real-time protocols with free breathing and those with breath holding for measurement of volumetric parameters.


CONCLUSION

Accelerated real-time 2D and segmented 3D cine techniques are comparable to the standard clinical protocol in assessment of left ventricular global and regional parameters in substantially shorter image times.},

	abstract = {Diastolic time (DT) is calculated as the cycle length (RR) minus electromechanical systole (QS2). The ratio of DT (RR-QS2) to RR interval times 100, or the percent diastole (\%D), varies nonlinearly with heart rate (HR), increasing rapidly with decreasing HR. The effect of commonly used cardioactive agents on \%D was studied in five groups of normal subjects. In group 1 (n = 12), propranolol (160 mg daily) increased \%D from 55.9 +/- 1.7 to 64.7 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.001) by slowing HR. In group 2 (n = 12), dobutamine (2.5 micrograms/kg/min) increased \%D from 56.4 +/- 1.4 to 61.8 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.005) by shortening the QS2. In group 3 (n = 10), Cedilanid-D (1.6 mg i.v.) increased \%D from 55.5 +/- 1 to 63.2 +/- 0.7 (p less than 0.001), both by slowing the HR and shortening the QS2. In group 4 (n = 12), isoproterenol (2 micrograms/min) increased HR and shortened the QS2 significantly. The net result was a significant reduction of \%D from 56.1 +/- 1.4 to 53.5 +/- 1.1, (p less than 0.05). In group 5 (n = 15), a 100-mg bolus of i.v. lidocaine did not have a significant effect on \%D. This study indicates that cardiovascular drugs may have significant effects on the relative duration of diastole either by affecting HR or the duration of systole. This may have clinical implications for patients with coronary artery disease and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, since in both cases coronary flow in mostly diastolic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To overcome flow and electrocardiogram-trigger artifacts in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), we have implemented a cardiac and respiratory self-gated cine ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence. We have assessed its performance in healthy mice by comparing the results with those obtained with a self-gated cine fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequence and with echocardiography.
METHODS: 2D self-gated cine UTE (TE/TR = 314 μs/6.2 ms, resolution: 129 × 129 μm, scan time per slice: 5 min 5 sec) and self-gated cine FLASH (TE/TR = 3 ms/6.2 ms, resolution: 129 × 129 μm, scan time per slice: 4 min 49 sec) images were acquired at 9.4 T. Volume of the left and right ventricular (LV, RV) myocardium as well as the end-diastolic and -systolic volume was segmented manually in MR images and myocardial mass, stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) and cardiac output (CO) were determined. Statistical differences were analyzed by using Student t test and Bland-Altman analyses.
RESULTS: Self-gated cine UTE provided high quality images with high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) also for the RV myocardium (CNRblood-myocardium = 25.5 ± 7.8). Compared to cine FLASH, susceptibility, motion, and flow artifacts were considerably reduced due to the short TE of 314 μs. The aortic valve was clearly discernible over the entire cardiac cycle. Myocardial mass, SV, EF and CO determined by self-gated UTE were identical to the values measured with self-gated FLASH and showed good agreement to the results obtained by echocardiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-gated UTE allows for robust measurement of cardiac parameters of diagnostic interest. Image quality is superior to self-gated FLASH, rendering the method a powerful alternative for the assessment of cardiac function at high magnetic fields.},

Materials and Methods: The local research ethics committee approved this study, and written consent was obtained from all patients or guardians. Stroke volumes were quantified in 40 patients (mean age ± standard deviation: 21.4 years ± 13.8, age range: 3.0–61.3 years; 22 male patients aged 3.0–38.0 years [mean age, 17.2 years ± 10.5], 18 female patients aged 4.7–61.3 years [mean age, 26.6 years ± 15.9]) with congenital heart disease in the aorta (n = 40), main pulmonary artery (n = 38), right pulmonary artery (n = 22), and left pulmonary artery (n = 24). Stroke volumes were obtained with (a) breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR imaging with SENSE, (b) conventional breath-hold cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging, and (c) reference free-breathing phase-contrast MR imaging. Stroke volumes were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance, Bland-Altman analysis, and correlation coefficients.
Results: Imaging time with the breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR sequence was significantly lower than that with the conventional breath-hold phase-contrast MR sequence ({\textasciitilde}5 seconds vs {\textasciitilde}16 seconds, respectively; P {\textless} .0001). There was excellent agreement in stroke volumes in all vessels between the reference free-breathing sequence (mean volume, 60.3 mL ± 27.3) and the two breath-hold sequences—spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.5 mL ± 27.1; P {\textless} .001) and conventional cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.8 mL ± 27.6; P = .268). The limits of agreement were smaller with the spiral breath-hold sequence than with the conventional breath-hold sequence (−4.4 mL, 2.9 mL vs −10.3 mL, 9.3 mL, respectively); correlation was similar (r = 0.998 vs r = 0.984, respectively).
Conclusion: Flow volumes can be accurately and reliably quantified by using a spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR sequence, with high spatiotemporal resolution obtained in a short breath hold. © RSNA, 2011 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101844/-/DC1},

Here a temporally constrained reconstruction (TCR) technique that requires less k-space data over time to obtain good-quality reconstructed images is proposed. This approach can be used to improve the spatial or temporal resolution, or increase the coverage of the object of interest. The method jointly reconstructs the space-time data iteratively with a temporal constraint in order to resolve aliasing. The method was implemented and its feasibility tested on DCE myocardial perfusion data with little or no motion. The results obtained from sparse k-space data using the TCR method were compared with results obtained with a sliding-window (SW) method and from full data using the standard inverse Fourier transform (IFT) reconstruction. Acceleration factors of 5 (R = 5) were achieved without a significant loss in image quality. Mean improvements of 28 ± 4\% in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 14 ± 4\% in the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were observed in the images reconstructed using the TCR method on sparse data (R = 5) compared to the standard IFT reconstructions from full data for the perfusion datasets. The method has the potential to improve dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging and also to reconstruct other sparse dynamic MR acquisitions. Magn Reson Med 57:1027–1036, 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We propose to directly register the set of 2D slices to the preoperative images. We argue this has a number of advantages, including the omission of the potentially complex reconstruction step, greater adaptability of the similarity measures, and easier parallelization. We describe a system for performing this task and present results on phantom data that show that our slice based method consistently outperforms a reconstruction based method in both speed and accuracy.},

In addition to previously reported parameters of changes in areas and chords, a new simple measurement of tricuspid annular excursion was correlated with RVEF. A close correlation was noted between tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and RVEF (r = 0.92). The RV end-diastolic area (RVEDA) and percentage of systolic change in area in the apical four-chamber view also showed close correlation with RVEF (r = −0.76 and 0.81); however, the entire RV endocardium could only be traced in about half of our patients. The end-diastolic transverse chord length and the percentage of systolic change in chord length in the apical view showed a poor correlation with RVEF. The correlation between RVEF and both areas and chords measured in the subcostal view was poor. It is concluded that the measurement of TAPSE offers a simple echocardiographic parameter which reflects RVEF. This measurement is not dependent on either geometric assumptions or traceable endocardial edges. When the endocardial outlines could be traced, the apical four-chamber view was superior to the subcostal view in assessment of RV function.},

MR flow quantitation is performed with a gradient-echo MR sequence with high temporal resolution enabling measurements at frequent intervals throughout the cardiac cycle. MR flow quantitation uses the phase rather than the amplitude of the MR signal to reconstruct the images. These images, often referred to as MR velocity maps or velocity-encoded cine MR images, are two-dimensional displays of flow velocity. From these velocity maps, velocity and volume flow data can be obtained. Previous validation experiments have demonstrated the accuracy of MR velocity mapping, and this technique is now being applied successfully in several clinical fields. MR velocity mapping may be of considerable value when Doppler echocardiography results are unsatisfactory or equivocal, particularly because MR is suited for the analysis of volumetric flow and complex flow patterns. Among the vastly growing number of clinical cardiovascular applications that have been reported are the great arteries and veins, coronary vessels, valvular disease, and the abdominal and peripheral vessels.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Using high resolution cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), we aimed to detect new details of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function, to explain the twisting and longitudinal movements of the left ventricle.


METHODS

Using CMR phase contrast velocity mapping (also called Tissue Phase Mapping) regional wall motion patterns and longitudinally and circumferentially directed movements of the left ventricle were studied using a high temporal resolution technique in healthy male subjects (n = 14, age 23 +/- 3 years).


RESULTS

Previously undescribed systolic and diastolic motion patterns were obtained for left ventricular segments (based on the AHA segmental) and for basal, mid and apical segments. The summation of segmental motion results in a complex pattern of ventricular twisting and longitudinal motion in the normal human heart which underlies systolic and diastolic function. As viewed from the apex, the entire LV initially rotates in a counter-clockwise direction at the beginning of ventricular systole, followed by opposing clockwise rotation of the base and counter-clockwise rotation at the apex, resulting in ventricular torsion. Simultaneously, as the entire LV moves in an apical direction during systole, the base and apex move towards each other, with little net apical displacement. The reverse of these motion patterns occur in diastole.


CONCLUSION

Left ventricular function may be a consequence of the relative orientations and moments of torque of the sub-epicardial relative to the sub-endocardial myocyte layers, with influence from tethering of the heart to adjacent structures and the directional forces associated with blood flow. Understanding the complex mechanics of the left ventricle is vital to enable these techniques to be used for the evaluation of cardiac pathology.},

	abstract = {The investigation of nuclear moments by nuclear induction or, as it is sometimes called, magnetic resonance absorption has progressed in many laboratories and in a variety of directions since its initiation. We shall report upon two special developments in which we have recently been most interested.
The first is the establishment of suitable standards of comparison for the measurement of magnetic moments. While, until recently, the magnetic moment of the proton has been used as standard, there are now measurements carried out which give directly and with high precision the magnetic moment of the proton in units of the nuclear magneton. They are based upon the comparison of its resonance frequency with the orbital frequency of protons, circulating in the same magnetic field. The latter frequency has been measured by observing either the accelerating or the decelerating action of an applied electric field at radio frequencies. Both methods will be discussed and results will be presented.
The second development is the application of nuclear induction to a great variety of different nuclei. The proper choice in the chemical composition of the sample is here of major importance in order to obtain suitable concentration, relaxation time and line width. Particularly in cases where the nucleus possesses a large electric quadrupole moment, it is important to find a compound such that the broadening electric field gradients are greatly reduced by the symmetry of the molecule. It has been found, in this connection, that different compounds can lead to different resonance frequencies for the same nucleus, the largest differences, sofar observed, being that of certain cobalt compounds and amounting to more than one percent. A possible interpretation of these chemical effects will be presented.},

	abstract = {Purpose

Myocardial T1 mapping is an emerging technique that could improve cardiovascular magnetic resonance diagnostic accuracy. In this study, a variable flip angle approach with B1 correction is proposed at 3T on the myocardium, employing standard 3D spoiled fast gradient echo and echo planar imaging sequences.


Methods

The method was tested on phantoms to determine the set of standard 3D spoiled fast gradient echo angles adapted to myocardial T1 measurements and was compared to the inversion-recovery spin-echo reference T1 method. Seven volunteers underwent magnetic imaging resonance to acquire myocardial T1 maps and T1 values of the human heart.


Results

This original method demonstrated good reproducibility in phantoms and a significant correlation between variable flip angle T1 values and reference inversion-recovery spin-echo T1 values. It yielded myocardial T1 values consistent with expected T1 and an increasing homogenization of myocardial segments owing to B1 correction. The mean myocardial T1 value was 1341 ± 42 ms.


Conclusion

Myocardial 3D T1 mapping using the variable flip angle approach can potentially be useful for evaluating fibrosis on the entire myocardium using a standard clinical sequence. Magn Reson Med 71:823–829, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of parallel transmission RF pulse designs so far are based on small-tip-angle (STA) approximation of the Bloch equation. These methods can design only excitation pulses with small flip angles (e.g., 30°). The linear class large-tip-angle (LCLTA) method is able to design large-tip-angle parallel transmission pulses through concatenating a sequence of small-excitation pulses when certain k-space trajectories are used. However, both STA and LCLTA are linear approximations of the nonlinear Bloch equation. Therefore, distortions from the ideal magnetization profiles due to the higher order terms can appear in the final magnetization profiles. This issue is addressed in this work by formulating the multidimensional multichannel RF pulse design as an optimal control problem with multiple controls based directly on the Bloch equation. Necessary conditions for the optimal solution are derived and a first-order gradient optimization algorithm is used to iteratively solve the optimal control problem, where an existing pulse is used as an initial “guess.” A systematic design procedure is also presented. Bloch simulation and phantom experimental results using various parallel transmission pulses (excitation, inversion, and refocusing) are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the optimal control method in improving the spatial localization or homogeneity of the magnetization profiles.

	abstract = {There are many excellent specialised texts and articles that describe the physical principles of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques. There are also many texts written with the clinician in mind that provide an understandable, more general introduction to the basic physical principles of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques and applications. There are however very few texts or articles that attempt to provide a basic MR physics introduction that is tailored for clinicians using CMR in their daily practice. This is the first of two reviews that are intended to cover the essential aspects of CMR physics in a way that is understandable and relevant to this group. It begins by explaining the basic physical principles of MR, including a description of the main components of an MR imaging system and the three types of magnetic field that they generate. The origin and method of production of the MR signal in biological systems are explained, focusing in particular on the two tissue magnetisation relaxation properties (T1 and T2) that give rise to signal differences from tissues, showing how they can be exploited to generate image contrast for tissue characterisation. The method most commonly used to localise and encode MR signal echoes to form a cross sectional image is described, introducing the concept of k-space and showing how the MR signal data stored within it relates to properties within the reconstructed image. Before describing the CMR acquisition methods in detail, the basic spin echo and gradient pulse sequences are introduced, identifying the key parameters that influence image contrast, including appearances in the presence of flowing blood, resolution and image acquisition time. The main derivatives of these two pulse sequences used for cardiac imaging are then described in more detail. Two of the key requirements for CMR are the need for data acquisition first to be to be synchronised with the subject's ECG and to be fast enough for the subject to be able to hold their breath. Methods of ECG synchronisation using both triggering and retrospective gating approaches, and accelerated data acquisition using turbo or fast spin echo and gradient echo pulse sequences are therefore outlined in some detail. It is shown how double inversion black blood preparation combined with turbo or fast spin echo pulse sequences acquisition is used to achieve high quality anatomical imaging. For functional cardiac imaging using cine gradient echo pulse sequences two derivatives of the gradient echo pulse sequence; spoiled gradient echo and balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) are compared. In each case key relevant imaging parameters and vendor-specific terms are defined and explained.},

	issn = {0278-4297},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess global ventricular function in patients with uremia by means of the myocardial performance index (MPI) derived from tissue Doppler echocardiography.
METHODS: According to the left ventricular mass index and pericardial effusion, 45 patients with uremia were classified into 2 groups: a uremia group and a uremia with pericardial effusion group. To calculate left ventricular MPI (LVMPI) and right ventricular MPI (RVMPI) by tissue Doppler echocardiography, the isovolumic contraction time (ICT), isovolumic relaxation time (IRT), and ejection time (ET) were measured at different sites in the mitral and tricuspid annuli.
RESULTS: The mean ICT and IRT were longer, the ET was shorter, and the LVMPI and RVMPI were higher in the 2 disease groups than in a control group, and the indices were higher in the uremia with pericardial effusion group than in the uremia group. The increase of the LVMPI was more obvious than that of the RVMPI. There was a significant difference in the mean LVMPI and RVMPI among the 3 groups (P{\textless}.01). The MPI was positively correlated with the IRT and the sum of the ICT and IRT and negatively correlated with the ET.
CONCLUSIONS: Both left and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function are impaired in patients with uremia. The MPI could be measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography, and we suggest that this index provides a novel, noninvasive method for clinical research on global myocardial performance in patients with uremia.},

By using a rotating phantom and postprocessing algorithm for phase tracking, errors arising during data acquisition were identified and compensation methods were developed. A spatially varying background phase offset in the velocity images was found to be due to eddy current-induced fields. The magnitude of the offset was in the range of 0–20 cm/sec, which is of the same order of magnitude as cardiac contractile velocities. Background offset is thus an important source of error in tracking cardiac motion. Study of different tracking algorithms revealed the need for an integration scheme using motion terms higher than velocity. Also, considerable improvement in the accuracy and stability of the predicted trajectories was obtained by averaging the trajectories proceeding both forward and backward in time from the starting point. With the algorithm developed, the motion of the phantom was tracked through a complete rotation of the phantom to an accuracy of 2 pixels.},

The differences with the reference TDI wave velocities were lower (p = 0.02) for free-breathing PC (19.2 ± 2.6 \%) than for breath-hold PC (28.1 ± 2.9 \%).

The importance of right ventricular (RV) function in the clinical management of patients with cardiopulmonary disorders is now well recognized. However, due to both its shape and location and to the load dependence of its ejection fraction, accurate evaluation of its function is still a challenge. Echocardiography allows morphological, hemodynamic and functional assessment of the right heart. Displacement and deformation parameters derived from new techniques are promising tools. 3D echocardiography also has a potential interest in the quantification of RV volumes and ejection fraction. Radionuclide technique allows an easy and accurate measurement of right ventricular ejection fraction. MRI remains nowadays the technique of choice for the quantification of volumes and function of the RV. All these techniques have proven their interest in various diseases affecting the right heart. RV function is an important prognostic factor in heart failure and is a major component of functional capacity in such patients. In pulmonary arterial hypertension, echocardiography is the best tool for the routine follow-up of patients. Finally, all these non-invasive techniques of investigation of the right heart enable the diagnosis of specific right ventricular damage such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.},

	abstract = {OBJECT: Internal MRI coils have important applications in diagnostic and interventional studies. Since they can be placed very close to the region of interest in the body, they are favored over external coils in applications where high-resolution images are required. In this paper it is demonstrated that ultimate intrinsic SNR (UISNR) and the optimum coil sensitivity solutions can be used to make new coil designs with higher intrinsic SNR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, UISNR, which is the maximum attainable value of the intrinsic SNR, is used as a measure of performance and as a design criterion. As an example, a novel endorectal MRI coil is designed. The design is tested with phantom and patient studies.
RESULTS: An endorectal coil is built to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design strategy. ISNR of the endorectal coil approximates the UISNR to 72\%.
CONCLUSION: An internal coil design method that takes advantage of the UISNR and optimum coil sensitivity calculations was presented. This method can also be used to design better internal MRI coils for different applications.},

	abstract = {The desire to visualize noninvasively physiological processes at high temporal resolution has been a driving force for the development of MRI since its inception in 1973. In this article, we describe a unique method for real-time MRI that reduces image acquisition times to only 20 ms. Although approaching the ultimate limit of MRI technology, the method yields high image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and the absence of artifacts. As proposed previously, a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) gradient-echo MRI technique (which allows for rapid and continuous image acquisitions) is combined with a radial encoding scheme (which offers motion robustness and moderate tolerance to data undersampling) and, most importantly, an iterative image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion (which exploits the advantages of parallel imaging with multiple receiver coils). In this article, the extension of regularization and filtering to the temporal domain exploits consistencies in successive data acquisitions and thereby enhances the degree of radial undersampling in a hitherto unexpected manner by one order of magnitude. The results obtained for turbulent flow, human speech production and human heart function demonstrate considerable potential for real-time MRI studies of dynamic processes in a wide range of scientific and clinical settings.

	abstract = {Background—Noninvasive assessment of diastolic filling by Doppler echocardiography provides important information about left ventricular (LV) status in selected subsets of patients. This study was designed to assess whether mitral annular velocities as assessed by tissue Doppler imaging are associated with invasive measures of diastolic LV performance and whether additional information is gained over traditional Doppler variables.
Methods and Results—One hundred consecutive patients referred for cardiac catheterization underwent simultaneous Doppler interrogation. Invasive measurements of LV pressures were obtained with micromanometer-tipped catheters, and the mean LV diastolic pressure (M-LVDP) was used as a surrogate for mean left atrial pressure. Doppler signals from the mitral inflow, pulmonary venous inflow, and TDI of the mitral annulus were obtained. Isolated parameters of transmitral flow correlated with M-LVDP only when ejection fraction {\textless}50\%. The ratio of mitral velocity to early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (E/E′) showed a better correlation with M-LVDP than did other Doppler variables for all levels of systolic function. E/E′ {\textless}8 accurately predicted normal M-LVDP, and E/E′ {\textgreater}15 identified increased M-LVDP. Wide variability was present in those with E/E′ of 8 to 15. A subset of those patients with E/E′ 8 to 15 could be further defined by use of other Doppler data.
Conclusions—The combination of tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus and mitral inflow velocity curves provides better estimates of LV filling pressures than other methods (pulmonary vein, preload reduction). However, accurate prediction of filling pressures for an individual patient requires a stepwise approach incorporating all available data.},

Three axes were scanned without PAT (no PAT) and using the generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) and modified sensitivity encoding (mSENSE) reconstruction algorithms with an autocalibration mode to reduce scan time. A conventional spine array and a body flex array were used. Artifacts, image noise, and overall image quality were classified on a 4-point scale by an observer blinded to the implemented technique; for quantitative comparison, SNR was measured.ResultsWith a PAT factor of two, acquisition time could be reduced by 39\%. No PAT did not show artifacts, and GRAPPA revealed fewer artifacts than mSENSE. PAT provided inferior-quality scores concerning image noise and overall image quality. In quantitative measurements, GRAPPA and mSENSE (20.1 ± 6.2 and 15.6 ± 6.2, respectively) yielded lower SNR than no PAT (30.6 ± 20.1; P {\textless} 0.05) and P {\textless} 0.001).ConclusionTime savings in PAT are accompanied by artifacts and an increase in image noise.

	abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) has been demonstrated to accelerate MRI acquisitions by reconstructing sparse images of good quality from highly undersampled data. Motion during MR scans can cause inconsistencies in k-space data, resulting in strong motion artifacts in the reconstructed images. For CS to be useful in these applications, motion correction techniques need to be combined with the undersampled reconstruction. Recently, joint motion correction and CS approaches have been proposed to partially correct for effects of motion. However, the main limitation of these approaches is that they can only correct for affine deformations. In this work, we propose a novel motion corrected CS framework for free-breathing dynamic cardiac MRI that incorporates a general motion correction formulation directly into the CS reconstruction. This framework can correct for arbitrary affine or nonrigid motion in the CS reconstructed cardiac images, while simultaneously benefiting from highly accelerated MR acquisition. The application of this approach is demonstrated both in simulations and in vivo data for 2D respiratory self-gated free-breathing cardiac CINE MRI, using a golden angle radial acquisition. Results show that this approach allows for the reconstruction of respiratory motion corrected cardiac CINE images with similar quality to breath-held acquisitions.

Normal values exist for adults, but are lacking for children.We sought to establish normal values for left and right ventricular volumes, mass and function in healthy children by using SSFP.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty children (27 females, 23 males) without cardiovascular disease were evaluated. Median age was 11 years (range 7 months - 18 years), weight 35 kg (range 7-77 kg), height 146 cm (range 66-181 cm). Thirty-six examinations were performed with breath holding, 14 in freely breathing sedated children.Ventricular volumes and mass were measured in the end systolic and end diastolic phase on SSFP cine images acquired in a short axis plane as a stack of 12 contiguous slices covering full length of both ventricles. Regression analysis showed an exponential relationship between body surface area (BSA) and ventricular volumes and mass (normal value = a*BSAb). Normative curves for males and females are presented in relation to BSA for the end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and mass of both ventricles. Intra- and interobserver variability of the measurements was within the limits of 2\% and 7\% respectively, except for right ventricular mass (10\%).
CONCLUSION: The exponential equation for calculation of normal values for each ventricular parameter and graphical display of normative curves for data acquired in healthy children by SSFP cardiovascular magnetic resonance are provided.},

The problem is further compounded in diffusion tensor imaging because of long acquisition times, and the sensitivity of the tensor computation to even small misregistration. To combat motion artifacts in diffusion tensor imaging, a novel real-time prospective motion correction method was introduced using an in-bore monovision system. The system consists of a camera mounted on the head coil and a self-encoded checkerboard marker that is attached to the patient's forehead. Our experiments showed that optical prospective motion correction is more effective at removing motion artifacts compared to image-based retrospective motion correction. Statistical analysis revealed a significant improvement in similarity between diffusion data acquired at different time points when prospective correction was used compared to retrospective correction (P {\textless} 0.001).

View sharing was implemented in both fast gradient-echo and fast phase-contrast cine acquisitions; breath holding was used when possible. RESULTS: Uniform repetition time (TR) radio-frequency (RF) excitation allowed a better assessment of the end-diastolic ventricular volume. In addition, view sharing provided a better estimate of end-systolic ventricular volume in cases in which rapid changes in volume occurred at or about the temporal boundary of the source images. View sharing also provided a much smoother representation of dynamic cardiac motion when viewed in a cine loop.

They are robust to flow and motion, have diffuse aliasing patterns, and support short readouts and echo times.

A set of fast, simple algorithms for 2-D and 3-D PR, and 3-D cones acquisitions are introduced that match the sampling density in frequency space to the desired FOV shape. Tailoring the acquisitions allows for reduction of aliasing artifacts in undersampled applications or scan time reductions without introducing aliasing in fully-sampled applications. It also makes possible new radial imaging applications that were previously unsuitable, such as imaging elongated regions or thin slabs. 2-D PR longitudinal leg images and thin-slab, single breath-hold 3-D PR abdomen images, both with isotropic resolution, demonstrate these new possibilities.

	abstract = {The desire to visualize noninvasively physiological processes at high temporal resolution has been a driving force for the development of MRI since its inception in 1973. In this article, we describe a unique method for real-time MRI that reduces image acquisition times to only 20 ms. Although approaching the ultimate limit of MRI technology, the method yields high image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and the absence of artifacts. As proposed previously, a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) gradient-echo MRI technique (which allows for rapid and continuous image acquisitions) is combined with a radial encoding scheme (which offers motion robustness and moderate tolerance to data undersampling) and, most importantly, an iterative image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion (which exploits the advantages of parallel imaging with multiple receiver coils). In this article, the extension of regularization and filtering to the temporal domain exploits consistencies in successive data acquisitions and thereby enhances the degree of radial undersampling in a hitherto unexpected manner by one order of magnitude. The results obtained for turbulent flow, human speech production and human heart function demonstrate considerable potential for real-time MRI studies of dynamic processes in a wide range of scientific and clinical settings.

	abstract = {Phase-contrast (PC) cine MRI is a promising method for assessment of pathologic hemodynamics, including cardiovascular and hepatoportal vascular dynamics, but its low data acquisition efficiency limits the achievable spatial and temporal resolutions within clinically acceptable breath-hold durations. We propose to accelerate PC cine MRI using an approach which combines compressed sensing and parallel imaging (k-t SPARSE-SENSE). We validated the proposed 6-fold accelerated PC cine MRI against 3-fold accelerated PC cine MRI with parallel imaging (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions). With the programmable flow pump, we simulated a time varying waveform emulating hepatic blood flow. Normalized root mean square error between two sets of velocity measurements was 2.59\%. In multiple blood vessels of 12 control subjects, two sets of mean velocity measurements were in good agreement (mean difference = −0.29 cm/s; lower and upper 95\% limits of agreement = −5.26 and 4.67 cm/s, respectively). The mean phase noise, defined as the standard deviation of the phase in a homogeneous stationary region, was significantly lower for k-t SPARSE-SENSE than for generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (0.05 ± 0.01 vs. 0.19 ± 0.06 radians, respectively; P {\textless} 0.01). The proposed 6-fold accelerated PC cine MRI pulse sequence with k-t SPARSE-SENSE is a promising investigational method for rapid velocity measurement with relatively high spatial (1.7 mm × 1.7 mm) and temporal (∼35 ms) resolutions.

A semiautomated method has been developed that substantially reduces both effects. To remove the background phase distortion, the following steps were taken: The time standard deviations of the phase velocity images over a cardiac cycle were calculated. Static regions were identified as those in which the standard deviation was low. A flat surface representing an approximation to the background distortion was fitted to the static regions and subtracted from the phase velocity images to give corrected phase images. Random noise was removed by setting to zero those regions in which the standard deviation was high. The technique is demonstrated with a sample set of data in which the in-plane velocities have been measured in an imaging section showing the left ventricular outflow tract of a human left ventricle. The results are presented in vector and contour form, superimposed on the conventional MR angiographic images.},

	abstract = {A parallel image reconstruction algorithm is presented that exploits the k-space locality in radiofrequency (RF) coil encoded data. In RF coil encoding, information relevant to reconstructing an omitted datum rapidly diminishes as a function of k-space separation between the omitted datum and the acquired signal data. The proposed method, parallel magnetic resonance imaging with adaptive radius in k-space (PARS), harnesses this physical property of RF coil encoding via a sliding-kernel approach. Unlike generalized parallel imaging approaches that might typically involve inverting a prohibitively large matrix for arbitrary sampling trajectories, the PARS sliding-kernel approach creates manageable and distributable independent matrices to be inverted, achieving both computational efficiency and numerical stability. An empirical method designed to measure total error power is described, and the total error power of PARS reconstructions is studied over a range of k-space radii and accelerations, revealing “minimal-error” conditions at comparatively modest k-space radii. PARS reconstructions of undersampled in vivo Cartesian and non-Cartesian data sets are shown and are compared selectively with traditional SENSE reconstructions. Various characteristics of the PARS k-space locality constraint (such as the tradeoff between signal-to-noise ratio and artifact power and the relationship with iterative parallel conjugate gradient approaches or nonparallel gridding approaches) are discussed.

The method has a potential to provide higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) efficiency with reduced imaging artifacts compared to conventional approaches. Previous experimental results suggested that the level of the functional contrast and its characteristics are significantly influenced by the sequence parameters. However, few of these contrast characteristics have been investigated systematically. In this study, a computer simulation was performed to investigate the sources of functional contrast and the influence of scan parameters on the functional contrast to elucidate the contrast characteristics of pass-band bSSFP fMRI.

	abstract = {In this article a new slice-based 3D prostate segmentation method based on a continuity constraint, implemented as an autoregressive (AR) model is described. In order to decrease the propagated segmentation error produced by the slice-based 3D segmentation method, a continuity constraint was imposed in the prostate segmentation algorithm. A 3D ultrasound image was segmented using the slice-based segmentation method. Then, a cross-sectional profile of the resulting contours was obtained by intersecting the 2D segmented contours with a coronal plane passing through the midpoint of the manually identified rotational axis, which is considered to be the approximate center of the prostate. On the coronal cross-sectional plane, these intersections form a set of radial lines directed from the center of the prostate. The lengths of these radial lines were smoothed using an AR model. Slice-based 3D segmentations were performed in the clockwise and in the anticlockwise directions, where clockwise and anticlockwise are defined with respect to the propagation directions on the coronal view. This resulted in two different segmentations for each 2D slice. For each pair of unmatched segments, in which the distance between the contour generated clockwise and that generated anticlockwise was greater than 4 mm, a method was used to select the optimal contour. Experiments performed using 3D prostate ultrasound images of nine patients demonstrated that the proposed method produced accurate 3D prostate boundaries without manual editing. The average distance between the proposed method and manual segmentation was 1.29 mm. The average intraobserver coefficient of variation (i.e., the standard deviation divided by the average volume) of the boundaries segmented by the proposed method was 1.6\%. The average segmentation time of a 352 x 379 x 704 image on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz PC was 10 s.},

Computer simulations, and in vitro and in vivo studies were performed in order to validate these expressions and to assess how accuracy is affected when different reduction factors are applied. It was shown that reproducibility depends on the reduction and geometry factors. Since the geometry factor varies spatially, so does the reproducibility for phase contrast imaging. In areas with high geometry factors, the standard deviation (SD) may become so large that aliasing occurs. The accuracy of phase contrast imaging is not influenced directly when SENSE is used, but may be indirectly influenced due to high SDs of the measured phase that may subsequently cause aliasing. The current results show that it is possible to achieve accurate flow measurements even at high reduction factors. By taking the geometry factor into account, it may be possible to find areas where phase contrast imaging is accurate even at high reduction factors.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an acquisition and reconstruction strategy for cardiac cine MRI that does not require the use of electrocardiogram or breath holding. The method has similarities with self-gated techniques as information about cardiac and respiratory motion is derived from the imaging sequence itself; here, by acquiring the center k-space line at the beginning of each segment of a balanced steady-state free precession sequence. However, the reconstruction step is fundamentally different: a generalized reconstruction by inversion of coupled systems is used instead of conventional gating. By correcting for nonrigid cardiac and respiratory motion, generalized reconstruction by inversion of coupled systems (GRICS) uses all acquired data, whereas gating rejects data acquired in certain motion states. The method relies on the processing and analysis of the k-space central line data: local information from a 32-channel cardiac coil is used in order to automatically extract eigenmodes of both cardiac and respiratory motion. In the GRICS framework, these eigenmodes are used as driving signals of a motion model. The motion model is defined piecewise, so that each cardiac phase is reconstructed independently. Results from six healthy volunteers, with various slice orientations, show improved image quality compared to combined respiratory and cardiac gating.},

The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement.

However, there is considerable clinical need for a simple, reproducible, and reliable parameter of right ventricular function in patients with right-sided heart disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical value of a Doppler-derived index, combining systolic and diastolic intervals of the right cycle, in assessing global right ventricular function in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. The study population comprised 26 consecutive patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 37 age-matched normal subjects. The sum of right ventricular isovolumetric contraction time and isovolumetric relaxation time was obtained by subtracting right ventricular ejection time from the interval between cessation and onset of the tricuspid inflow velocities with pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography. An index of combined right ventricular systolic and diastolic function was obtained by dividing the sum of both isovolumetric intervals by ejection time. The index was compared with available parameters of systolic or diastolic function, clinical symptoms, and survival. Right ventricular isovolumetric contraction time and isovolumetric relaxation time were prolonged significantly in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (85 ± 41 msec and 135 ± 43 msec) compared with normal subjects (38 ± 7 msec and 49 ± 9 msec, respectively; p \&lt; 0.001). Ejection time was shortened significantly in patients with pulmonary hypertension (241 ± 43 msec versus normal [322 ± 21 msec]; p \&lt; 0.001). However, the index was the single most powerful variable to discriminate patients with primary pulmonary hypertension from normal subjects (0.93 ± 0.34 versus 0.28 ± 0.04; p \&lt; 0.001) and was the strongest predictor of clinical status and survival. The index was not significantly affected by heart rate, right ventricular pressure, right ventricular dilation, or tricuspid regurgitation. It is well known that right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction coexist in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. This article reports the use of an easily obtainable Doppler-derived index that combines elements of systolic and diastolic function. This index appears to be a useful noninvasive means that correlates with symptoms and survival in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension.},

To compare multidirectional regional myocardial velocities between groups of subjects, a multisegment and multislice visualization model was employed. Regional myocardial motion was mapped onto the visualization model to display the current status of myocardial motion from base to apex as in-plane velocity vector fields in conjunction with color-coded long-axis plane motion. Moreover, correlation analysis was used to investigate regional differences in myocardial dynamics.ResultsAge-related changes in LV myocardial velocities resulted in significant differences of peak and time-to-peak velocities in the radial and long-axis directions. Correlation analysis revealed clearly visible regional differences in the temporal evolution of long-axis and circumferential velocities, particularly between the youngest and oldest age groups. Comparison of pathological LV motion with age-matched volunteers indicated marked regional alterations in myocardial velocities and dynamics.ConclusionHigh-temporal-resolution TPM in combination with a schematic visualization model and correlation analysis permits the identification of local changes in myocardial velocities associated with different age groups and a common LV pathology.

In its basic form k-t BLAST speeds up the data acquisition by undersampling k-space over time (referred to as k-t space). The resulting aliasing is resolved in the Fourier reciprocal x-f space (x = spatial position, f = temporal frequency) using an adaptive filter derived from a low-resolution estimate of the signal covariance. However, this filtering process tends to increase the reconstruction error or lower the achievable acceleration factor. This is problematic in applications exhibiting a broad range of temporal frequencies such as free-breathing myocardial perfusion imaging. We show that temporal basis functions calculated by subjecting the training data to principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to constrain the reconstruction such that the temporal resolution is improved.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Measurement of coronary sinus blood flow (CSF) by phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PC-MR) imaging at rest and during hyperemia may allow noninvasive assessment of global coronary hemodynamics.


METHODS AND RESULTS

Sixteen healthy volunteers (age, 22 to 32 years) were examined with MR and PET in random order within 1 to 2 days. At rest and during hyperemia (dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg), CSF was measured by a cine PC-MR technique (temporal resolution, 40 ms; spatial resolution, 1.25x0.8 mm(2)), and myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured by [(13)N]NH(3) PET. PET and MR agreed closely for coronary flow reserve (CFR; mean difference, 2.2+/-14.7\%; Bland-Altman method). CSF divided by either total left ventricular mass or an estimate of drained myocardium (LVM(drain)) correlated highly with PET flow data (r=0.93 and 0.95, respectively) and with measures of oxygen demand, ie, heart rate, afterload-corrected fiber shortening, and peak systolic stress determined by MR (overall correlation coefficients, 0.81 and 0.87, respectively, multivariate analysis). CSF/LVM(drain) did not differ significantly from PET-derived MBF (difference, 3.6+/-16.6\%). In orthotopic heart transplant recipients (n=9), CFR was reduced and blood supply-demand relationships at rest were shifted toward higher flows (P{\textless}0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS

This integrated MR approach allows comprehensive assessment of autoregulated and hyperemic coronary flow and is suitable for serial measurements in patients. In transplanted hearts, elevated resting flow is the major cause of reduced CFR.},

	abstract = {A method for magnetic resonance cine velocity mapping through heart valves with adaptation of both slice offset and angulation according to the motion of the valvular plane of the heart is presented. By means of a subtractive labeling technique, basal myocardial markers are obtained and automatically extracted for quantification of heart motion at the valvular level. The captured excursion of the basal plane is used to calculate the slice offset and angulation of each required time frame for cine velocity mapping. Through-plane velocity offsets are corrected by subtracting velocities introduced by basal plane motion from the measured velocities. For evaluation of the method, flow measurements downstream from the aortic valve were performed both with and without slice adaptation in 11 healthy volunteers and in four patients with aortic regurgitation. Maximum through-plane motion at the aortic root level as calculated from the labeled markers averaged 8.9 mm in the volunteers and 6.5 mm in the patients. The left coronary root was visible in 2–4 (mean: 2.2) time frames during early diastole when imaging with a spatially fixed slice. Time frames obtained with slice adaptation did not contain the coronary roots. Motion correction increased the apparent regurgitant volume by 5.7 ± 0.4 ml for patients with clinical aortic regurgitation, for an increase of approximately 50\%. The proposed method provides flow measurements with correction for through-plane motion perpendicular to the aortic root between the valvular annulus and the coronary ostia throughout the cardiac cycle.

	abstract = {Velocity imaging with phase contrast (PC) MRI is a noninvasive tool for quantitative blood flow measurement in vivo. A shortcoming of conventional PC imaging is the reduction in temporal resolution as compared to the corresponding magnitude imaging. For the measurement of velocity in a single direction, the temporal resolution is halved because one must acquire two differentially flow-encoded images for every PC image frame to subtract out non-velocity-related image phase information. In this study, a high temporal resolution PC technique which retains both the spatial resolution and breath-hold length of conventional magnitude imaging is presented. Improvement by a factor of 2 in the temporal resolution was achieved by acquiring the differentially flow-encoded images in separate breath-holds rather than interleaved within a single breath-hold. Additionally, a multiecho readout was incorporated into the PC experiment to acquire more views per unit time than is possible with the single gradient-echo technique. A total improvement in temporal resolution by ∼5 times over conventional PC imaging was achieved. A complete set of images containing velocity data in all three directions was acquired in four breath-holds, with a temporal resolution of 11.2 ms and an in-plane spatial resolution of 2 mm × 2 mm.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of cine MR Fourier velocimetry to measure flow through healthy cardiac valves and to compare MR and Doppler peak velocity measurements. Ten healthy volunteers (age mean +/- SD, 24 +/- 4 years) without history of valvular disease were studied. Four of the subjects were females. In each subject, aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid valves were evaluated with MR and Doppler imaging. A whole-body mobile MR machine was used, operating at .5-T with actively shielded magnetic field gradient coils on all three axes capable of 20 mT/m at a slew rate of 60 mT/ m/msec. The heart rate during MR and Doppler studies was not significantly different. The mean difference between the two studies was 2 beats/min, with a 95\% confidence interval of -22 beats/min, +25 beats/ min. Peak systolic flow velocity in the aortic and pulmonary valves and peak diastolic flow velocity in the mitral and tricuspid valves measured with MRI and Doppler echocardiography correlated well. The mean difference between the two measurements (MR-Doppler) was 63 mm/sec, with a 95\% confidence interval of -180 mm/sec, +310 mm/sec. The agreement between two observers interpreting the same MR velocity maps was close. The mean difference between their two measurements was 23 mm/sec, with a 95\% confidence interval of -20 mm/sec, +60 mm/sec. There was no significant difference between MR and Doppler imaging or between the two MR observers. MR Fourier velocimetry has the necessary ease, reliability, and speed to measure blood flow through the cardiac valves, although measurement of late diastolic flow in the atrioventricular valves is limited. Measurement of peak blood velocity through the cardiac valves by this method showed satisfactory agreement with Doppler, but its clinical application for assessing diseased cardiac valves must be established.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a systematic phantom comparison and clinical application of noninvasive pressure difference mapping in the human aorta based on time-resolved 3D phase contrast data. Relative pressure differences were calculated based on integration and iterative refinement of pressure gradients derived from MR-based three-directional velocity vector fields (flow-sensitive 4D MRI with spatial/temporal resolution ∼ 2.1 mm3/40 ms) using the Navier-Stokes equation. After in vitro study using a stenosis phantom, time-resolved 3D pressure gradients were systematically evaluated in the thoracic aorta in a group of 12 healthy subjects and 6 patients after repair for aortic coarctation. Results from the phantom study showed good agreement with expected values and standard methods (Bernoulli). Data of healthy subjects showed good intersubject consistency and good agreement with the literature. In patients, pressure waveforms showed elevated peak values. Pressure gradients across the stenosis were compared with reference measurements from Doppler ultrasound.

	abstract = {Four-dimensional (4D) flow imaging has been used to study flow patterns and pathophysiology, usually focused on specific thoracic vessels and cardiac chambers. Whole-heart 4D flow at high measurement accuracy covering the entire thoracic cardiovascular system would be desirable to simplify and improve hemodynamic assessment. This has been a challenge because compensation of respiratory motion is difficult to achieve, but it is paramount to limit artifacts and improve accuracy. In this work we propose a self-gating technique for respiratory motion-compensation integrated into a whole-heart 4D flow acquisition that overcomes these challenges. Flow components are measured in all three directions for each pixel over the complete cardiac cycle, and 1D volume projections are obtained at certain time intervals for respiratory gating in real time during the acquisition. The technique was tested in 15 volunteers, in which stroke volumes (SVs) in the great arteries showed excellent agreement with standard 2D phase-contrast (PC) scans. In contrast, nongated 4D flow with two averages had substantial disagreement with 2D flow. Applied to patients with congenital cardiac left-to-right shunting, the precision of flux data was highly beneficial. The methodology presented here has the potential to allow a complete study of flow pathophysiology of the thoracic cardiovascular system from a single free-breathing scan.

Here we propose to overcome these problems by the combination of an interleaved Radial Phase Encoding trajectory and the Phase Ordering with Automatic Window Selection method. This Radial Phase Encoding-Phase Ordering with Automatic Window Selection approach yields fast 3D whole-heart imaging with a high isotropic resolution and high navigator efficiency even for extremely irregular breathing. Numerical simulations were performed and Radial Phase Encoding-Phase Ordering with Automatic Window Selection was implemented on a clinical scanner. A comparison between the proposed method and a respiratory gated 3D Cartesian approach was carried out. Radial Phase Encoding-Phase Ordering with Automatic Window Selection leads to a better depiction of coronary arteries and an increase in navigator efficiency.

At 3 T, the use of SSFP is limited by susceptibility-induced off-resonance, resulting in either banding artifacts or the need to use a short-sequence pulse repetition time that limits the readout duration and hence the achievable spatial resolution. In this work, we apply wideband SSFP, a variant of SSFP that uses two alternating pulse repetition times to establish a steady state with wider band spacing in its frequency response and overcome the key limitations of SSFP. Prospectively gated cine two-dimensional imaging with wideband SSFP is evaluated in healthy volunteers and compared to conventional balanced SSFP, using quantitative metrics and qualitative interpretation by experienced clinicians. We demonstrate that by trading off temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio efficiency, wideband SSFP mitigates banding artifacts and enables imaging with approximately 30\% higher spatial resolution compared to conventional SSFP with the same effective band spacing.},

	abstract = {Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) MRI is a rapid and SNR-efficient imaging method, but suffers from characteristic bands of signal loss in regions of large field inhomogeneity. Several methods have been developed to reduce the severity of these banding artifacts, typically involving the acquisition of multiple bSSFP data sets (and the accompanying increase in scan time). Fat suppression with bSSFP is also challenging; most existing methods require an additional increase in scan time, and some are incompatible with bSSFP band-reduction techniques., This work was motivated by the need for both robust fat suppression and band reduction in the presence of field inhomogeneity when using bSSFP for flow-independent peripheral angiography. The large flip angles used in this application to improve vessel conspicuity and contrast lead to SAR considerations, longer TR, and increased severity of banding artifacts. In this work, a novel method that simultaneously suppresses fat and reduces bSSFP banding artifact with the acquisition of only two phase-cycled bSSFP data sets is presented. A weighted sum of the two bSSFP acquisitions is taken on a voxel-by-voxel basis, effectively synthesizing an off-resonance profile at each voxel that puts fat in the stop band while keeping water in the pass band. The technique exploits the near-sinusoidal shape of the bSSFP off-resonance spectrum for many tissues at large ({\textgreater}50 degrees) flip angles.},

	abstract = {Understanding the morphology and function of heart valves is important to the study of underlying causes of heart failure. Existing techniques such as those based on echocardiography are limited by the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), attenuation artefacts, and restricted access. The alternative of cardiovascular MR imaging offers versatility and accuracy in 3D localisation, but is hampered by large movements of the valves throughout the cardiac cycle. This paper presents a motion-compensated adaptive imaging approach for MR valve imaging. To illustrate its clinical potential, 3D motion of the aortic valve plane is first captured through a single breath-hold COMB tag pre-scan and then tracked in real-time with an automatic method based on multi-resolution image registration. Motion-compensated coverage of the aortic valve is then acquired prospectively, thus allowing its clear 3D reconstruction and visualisation. To provide isotropic voxel coverage of the imaging volume, retrospective projection onto convex sets (POCS) super-resolution enhancement is applied to the slice-select direction. In vivo results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed motion-compensation and super-resolution schemes for depicting the structure of the valve leaflets throughout the cardiac cycle. The proposed method fundamentally changes the way MR imaging is performed by transforming it from a spatially to materially localised imaging method. This also has important implications for quantifying blood flow and myocardial perfusion, as well as tracking anatomy and function of the heart.},

The theoretical PWV value was derived from the Moens-Korteweg equation after measurement of the tube elastic modulus by uniaxial tensile testing (PWV = 6.6 ± 0.7 m/s). Repeatability was assessed on 20 healthy volunteers undergoing three consecutive MR examinations.Results:FVE M-mode PWV was more repeatable than 2D-PC PWV independently of the analysis technique used. The early systolic fit (ESF) method, followed by the maximum of the first derivative (1st der.) method, was the most accurate (PWV = 6.8 ± 0.4 m/s and PWV = 7.0 ± 0.6 m/s, respectively) and repeatable (inter-scan within-subject variation δ = 0.096 and δ = 0.107, respectively) for FVE M-mode. For 2D-PC, the 1st der. method performed best in terms of accuracy (PWV = 6.8 ± 1.1 m/s), whereas the ESF algorithm was the most repeatable (δ = 0.386).Conclusion:FVE M-mode allows rapid, accurate and repeatable central PWV evaluation when the ESF algorithm is used. 2D-PC requires long scan times and can provide accurate although much less repeatable PWV measurements when the 1st der. method is used.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Three-dimensional (3D) navigator-gated and prospectively corrected free-breathing coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) allows for submillimeter image resolution but suffers from poor contrast between coronary blood and myocardium. Data collected over {\textgreater}100 ms/heart beat are also susceptible to bulk cardiac and respiratory motion. To address these problems, we examined the effect of a T2 preparation prepulse (T2prep) for myocardial suppression and a shortened acquisition window on coronary definition.


METHODS AND RESULTS

Eight healthy adult subjects and 5 patients with confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent free-breathing 3D MRA with and without T2prep and with 120- and 60-ms data-acquisition windows. The T2prep resulted in a 123\% (P{\textless}0. 001) increase in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Coronary edge definition was improved by 33\% (P{\textless}0.001). Acquisition window shortening from 120 to 60 ms resulted in better vessel definition (11\%; P{\textless}0.001). Among patients with CAD, there was a good correspondence with disease.


CONCLUSIONS

Free-breathing, T2prep, 3D coronary MRA with a shorter acquisition window resulted in improved CNR and better coronary artery definition, allowing the assessment of coronary disease. This approach offers the potential for free-breathing, noninvasive assessment of the major coronary arteries.},

PC-MRI methods require acquisition of additional data to enable phase difference reconstruction, making real-time imaging problematic. Shared Velocity Encoding (SVE), a method devised to improve the effective temporal resolution of PC-MRI, was implemented in a real-time pulse sequence with segmented echo planar readout. The effect of SVE on peak velocity measurement was investigated in computer simulation, and peak velocities and total flow were measured in a flow phantom and in volunteers and compared with a conventional ECG-triggered, segmented k-space phase-contrast sequence as a reference standard. Computer simulation showed a 36\% reduction in peak velocity error from 8.8\% to 5.6\% with SVE. A similar reduction of 40\% in peak velocity error was shown in a pulsatile flow phantom. In the phantom and volunteers, volume flow did not differ significantly when measured with or without SVE. Peak velocity measurements made in the volunteers using SVE showed a higher concordance correlation (0.96) with the reference standard than non-SVE (0.87). The improvement in effective temporal resolution with SVE reconstruction has a positive impact on the precision and accuracy of real-time PC-MRI peak velocity measurements.},

	url = {http://www.ajronline.org/content/150/3/513.abstract},
	abstract = {Anatomic structures that move periodically during the acquisition of data for an MR image become multiple ghosts in the phase-encoding direction. There is a constant spacing in pixels between consecutive ghosts, which is equal to the number of cycles of motion that occurred during the acquisition of data. The intensity of ghosts depends on the intensity of the moving structure and the number of pixels over which the motion occurred. No single method is completely satisfactory at suppressing motion artifacts. The major attributes and limitations of each method are summarized in Table 2, with plus (+) signs denoting merit. Theoretically, some methods perform better in reducing the intensity of ghosts and restoring the image intensity to its proper place. This certainly is not the final criterion, however. Some methods reduce the blurring in addition to suppressing the ghosts, or they suppress ghosts without prolonging the time for imaging. Certain methods also reduce ghosts from other kinds of motion. It is very appealing for a method to function without monitoring. The success of monitoring often depends too much on the cooperation of both the patient and technologist. The theoretical performance, attributes, and deficiencies of the various methods have been combined into a subjective overall rating in the last column of Table 2. All of the methods can be effective under the appropriate circumstances. Moreover, the methods are not mutually exclusive. It is advantageous, therefore, to combine methods to achieve even greater suppression. For example, physical restraint can be used for all but the most uncooperative patients. Most imaging techniques can be designed with gradients that rephase the signals from moving structures. Then other methods, such as averaging or reordering, can be applied as necessary. Fortunately, there are effective motion artifact suppression methods, even though not all are widely available yet on commercial equipment. Consistent suppression of motion artifacts will enhance the quality of MR images. Elimination of motion artifacts will improve the capability of MR to detect lesions and will provide a higher standard of performance for MR in the body.},

In older children and mature neonates with heart rates ranging from 69 to 196 beats/min., both duration of total systole and left ventricular ejection time diminished linearly and in parallel with increasing heart rate up to a level of 150 beats/min. At high levels of heart rate the phases of systole diminished more gradually with increasing heart rate. The isovolumetric contraction time tended to remain constant throughout the range of heart rates studied.

Among the premature neonates there was a wider distribution in the measured intervals, and left ventricular ejection time tended to be higher at any level of heart rate. The prolonged ejection time in this group can in part be attributed to the presence of anemia.},

	abstract = {Numerous techniques exist for suppressing ghosting artifacts due to respiratory motion on MR images. Although such methods can remove coherent ghosting artifacts, motion during gradient pulses also leads to poor image quality. This is due to phase variations at the echo caused by changes in velocity from one phase-encoding view to the next. The effect becomes severe for long sampling times and long TE values and can lead to low estimates of T2. We discuss general, robust modifications of the standard gradient or spin-echo sequences by using rephasing gradients that force the phase of constant-velocity moving spins to be zero at the echo. These sequences lead to a significant reduction in motion artifacts and hence improvement in image quality. They can be applied to multislice, multiecho, water/fat, and gating schemes as well. Since motion problems are universal, it would appear that these modified sequences should come into common usage for MR imaging.},

A shortcoming of conventional PC imaging is the reduction in temporal resolution as compared to the corresponding magnitude imaging. For the measurement of velocity in a single direction, the temporal resolution is halved because one must acquire two differentially flow-encoded images for every PC image frame to subtract out non-velocity-related image phase information. In this study, a high temporal resolution PC technique which retains both the spatial resolution and breath-hold length of conventional magnitude imaging is presented. Improvement by a factor of 2 in the temporal resolution was achieved by acquiring the differentially flow-encoded images in separate breath-holds rather than interleaved within a single breath-hold. Additionally, a multiecho readout was incorporated into the PC experiment to acquire more views per unit time than is possible with the single gradient-echo technique. A total improvement in temporal resolution by ∼5 times over conventional PC imaging was achieved. A complete set of images containing velocity data in all three directions was acquired in four breath-holds, with a temporal resolution of 11.2 ms and an in-plane spatial resolution of 2 mm × 2 mm.

	abstract = {Purpose:
To assess cardiac function by means of a novel free-breathing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strategy.
Materials and Methods:
A stack of ungated 2D steady-state free precession (SSFP) slices was acquired during free breathing and reconstructed as cardiac cine imaging based on the generalized reconstruction by inversion of coupled systems (GRICS). A motion-compensated sliding window approach allows reconstructing cine movies with most motion artifacts cancelled. The proposed reconstruction uses prior knowledge from respiratory belts and electrocardiogram recordings and features a piecewise linear model that relates the electrocardiogram signal to cardiac displacements. The free-breathing protocol was validated in six subjects against a standard breath-held protocol.
Results:
Image sharpness, as assessed by the image gradient entropy, was comparable to that of breath-held images and significantly better than in uncorrected images. Volumetric parameters of cardiac function in the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) were similar, including end-systolic volumes, end-diastolic volumes and mass, stroke volumes, and ejection fractions (with differences of 3\% ± 2.4 in the LV and 2.9\% ± 4.4 in the RV). The duration of the free-breathing protocol was nearly the same as the breath-held protocol.
Conclusion:

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to clarify the role of isovolumic intervals during a cardiac cycle by in vivo visualization of left ventricular (LV) intracavitary flow dynamics.
BACKGROUND: Asynchronous LV deformation during isovolumic contraction (IVC) and isovolumic relaxation (IVR) might represent a transient feature of myocardial wall mechanics that reverses the direction of blood flow.
METHODS: In 10 beating porcine hearts, the changes in LV intracavitary flow were recorded at baseline and after LV epicardial and right atrial pacing with high-resolution Doppler and contrast echocardiography. Two-dimensional vector flow fields were generated offline from B-mode contrast images with particle imaging velocimetry.
RESULTS: During IVC, flow from the LV apex accelerated toward the base, whereas blood from the base was redirected toward the outflow through formation of an anterior vortex. Conversely, during IVR, flow was initially directed toward the apex and then briefly reversed toward the base. Epicardial pacing from the LV base altered the stages of flow redirection during the pre-ejection period and delayed mitral valve closure (28 +/- 14 ms vs. 61 +/- 13 ms, p {\textless} 0.001) and aortic valve opening (77 +/- 18 ms vs. 111 +/- 18 ms, p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Isovolumic intervals are not periods of hemodynamic stasis but, rather, phases with dynamic changes in intracavitary flow. Experimentally induced aberrant epicardial electrical activation alters stages of flow redirection and prolongs the pre-ejection period. Normal electromechanical activation through the His-Purkinje system in mammalian hearts maintains an inherent synchrony with the sequence of intracavitary flow redirection.},

	abstract = {A method of determining the phase-encode order for MR Fourier-encoded imaging is described, which provides an additional option for optimizing images from samples with signals that change during data acquisition. Examples are in hyperpolarized helium gas imaging of the lungs where polarization is lost with each RF pulse or the signal changes observed in rapid dynamic studies with T(1) or T(2)* contrast agents when mixing is taking place. The method uses a single frequency-encoded projection in the proposed phase-encoding direction. The projection is subsequently sorted into signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) order. The indices of the sorted array are then used to create the phase-encode table to be used for the scan. This phase table is sorted in descending SNR order for signals that decrease during data acquisition and in ascending order for signals that increase during data acquisition. Simulations suggest that this technique can produce higher resolution than centric-ordered phase encoding at the expense of increased modulation (ghosting) artifact for dynamically changing signals. Initial practical implementation of the technique has been carried out on a dedicated 0.2-T Niche MR system, and the test object results agree well with simulations. Hyperpolarized 3-He lung images have also been acquired and postprocessed using the SNR phase order k-space encoding (SPOKE) methodology and show potential for improved imaging with high flip angles where polarization is rapidly lost. Applications may also be found for 3D volumetric acquisitions where two dimensions can be SPOKE encoded.},

The performance of such a method when using magnitude-reconstructed images is highly sensitive to the inversion recovery time (TI) selected. Using phase-sensitive reconstruction, it is possible to use a nominal value of TI, eliminate several breath-holds otherwise needed to find the precise null time for normal myocardium, and achieve a consistent contrast. Phase-sensitive detection is used to remove the background phase while preserving the sign of the desired magnetization during IR. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the benefits of both phase-sensitive IR image reconstruction and surface coil intensity normalization for detecting myocardial infarction (MI). The phase-sensitive reconstruction method reduces the variation in apparent infarct size that is observed in the magnitude images as TI is changed. Phase-sensitive detection also has the advantage of decreasing the sensitivity to changes in tissue T(1) with increasing delay from contrast agent injection.},

By incorporating SF into a cine DENSE sequence, and applying displacement encoding in three orthogonal directions, we demonstrate the ability to track discrete elements of a slice of myocardium in 3D as the heart moves through the cardiac cycle. The SF cine DENSE tracking algorithm was validated on a moving phantom, and the effects of through-plane motion on 2D cardiac strain were investigated in six healthy subjects.ResultsA through-plane tracking accuracy of 0.46 ± 0.32 mm was measured for a typical range of myocardial motion using a rotating phantom. In vivo 3D measurements of cardiac motion were consistent with prior myocardial tagging results. Through-plane rotation in a mid-ventricularshort-axis view was shown to decrease the magnitude of the 2D end-systolic circumferential strain by 3.91 ± 0.43\% and increase the corresponding radial strain by 6.01 ± 1.07\%.ConclusionSlice followed cine DENSE provides an accurate method for 3D tissue tracking.

	abstract = {The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used widely in signal processing for efficient computation of the FT of finite-length signals over a set of uniformly spaced frequency locations. However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The min-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.},

Data from MR tagging and harmonic phase (HARP) tracking were used to measure material point displacements, and 3D Lagrangian strains were calculated throughout the entire left ventricle (LV) with a deformable parametric model. A mouse model where cardiomyocytes are specifically made deficient in vinculin (VclKO) were compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. 3D strain analysis revealed differences in LV wall mechanics between WT and VclKO mice at 8 weeks of age when systolic function had just begun to decline. Most notably, end-systolic radial strain and torsional shear were reduced in VclKO hearts which contributed to regional mechanical dysfunction. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using MRI tagging methods to detect alterations in 3D myocardial strain distributions in genetically engineered mouse models of cardiovascular disease.},

Selective excitation concerns the production of an MR signal, while acquisition concerns the manipulation and collection of this signal. This thesis concerns several new approaches to the selective excitation phase of MRI. The connecting thread is the application of the powerful tools of linear systems theory to the non-linear Bloch equation. By constraining solutions to interesting linear subspaces of the Bloch equation a number of useful results are obtained. These include multidimensional selective excitation, imaging of chemical species with rapidly decaying signals, and direct specification and design for slice selective excitation.},

Additionally, the lower risk and cost in non-contrast enhanced (NCE) MRA has sparked renewed interest in these methods. This article discusses the current state of both contrast-enhanced (CE) and NCE-MRA. New CE-MRA methods take advantage of dose reduction at 3.0 T, novel contrast agents, and parallel imaging methods. The risks of gadolinium-based contrast media, and the NCE-MRA methods of time-of-flight, steady-state free precession, and phase contrast are discussed.},

The proposed method uses a new image model that represents the target image as a linear combination of a motion-dependent reference image and a sparse difference image. We then use an efficient iterative algorithm to jointly estimate the motion parameters and the difference image from sparsely sampled data. Simulation results from a numerical phantom data set and an in vivo data set show that the proposed method can accurately compensate the motion effects between the reference and the target images and improve reconstruction quality. The proposed method should prove useful for several applications such as interventional imaging, longitudinal imaging studies and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.},

	abstract = {In k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE, data acquisition is accelerated by sparsely sampling k-space over time. This undersampling in k-t space causes the object signals to be convolved with a point spread function in x-f space (x = spatial position, f = temporal frequency). The resulting aliasing is resolved by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations within the data. In general, reconstruction accuracy can be improved by controlling the k-t sampling pattern to minimize signal overlap in x-f space. In this work, we describe an approach to obtain generally favorable patterns for typical image series without specific knowledge of the image series itself. These optimized sampling patterns were applied to free-breathing, untriggered (i.e., real-time) cardiac imaging with steady-state free precession (SSFP). Eddy-current artifacts, which are otherwise increased drastically in SSFP by the undersampling, were minimized using alternating k-space sweeps. With the synergistic combination of the k-t approach with optimized sampling and SSFP with alternating k-space sweeps, it was possible to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, high contrast, and high spatiotemporal resolutions, while achieving substantial immunity against eddy currents. Cardiac images are shown, demonstrating excellent image quality and an in-plane resolution of approximately 2.0 mm at {\textgreater}25 frames/s, using one or more receiver coils.},

	abstract = {A new parallel imaging technique was implemented which can result in reduced image acquisition times in MRI. MR data is acquired in parallel using an array of receiver coils and then reconstructed simultaneously with multiple processors. The method requires the initial estimation of the 2D sensitivity profile of each coil used in the receiver array. These sensitivity profiles are then used to partially encode the images of interest. A fraction of the total number of k-space lines is consequently acquired and used in a parallel reconstruction scheme, allowing for a substantial reduction in scanning and display times. This technique is in the family of parallel acquisition schemes such as simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH) and sensitivity encoding (SENSE). It extends the use of the SMASH method to allow the placement of the receiver coil array around the object of interest, enabling imaging of any plane within the volume of interest. In addition, this technique permits the arbitrary choice of the set of k-space lines used in the reconstruction and lends itself to parallel reconstruction, hence allowing for real-time rendering. Simulated results with a 16-fold increase in temporal resolution are shown, as are experimental results with a 4-fold increase in temporal resolution. Magn Reson Med 44:301-308, 2000.},

	abstract = {Phase-contrast (PC) MRI is a noninvasive method for imaging blood and tissue velocity. PC experiments are typically segmented into many cardiac cycles in order to obtain sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, and thus require a gating signal to properly combine the data from multiple cardiac cycles. Although the surface electrode ECG is the gating waveform of choice for cardiovascular MRI, alternative gating methods are required for fetal cardiac imaging (due to the unavailability of fetal ECG signals) and for cases of ECG contamination via the strong magnetic fields within the MR scanner. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using imaging data from flow-encoded MRI experiments to derive times for cardiac gating. An undersampled radial k-space acquisition method is used to measure an image-derived flow-gating waveform in real-time, from which the gating times are derived. These gating times are used to reconstruct a conventional gated-segmented image series by combining the real-time data from multiple heartbeats. Flow-gated PC experiments were performed on five normal volunteers with slice prescriptions in four anatomic regions. The standard deviation (SD) of the difference between the flow-gating and ECG gating times ranged from 5 ms to 12 ms. Magn Reson Med 52:598–604, 2004. Published 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This study presents a Cartesian CINE MRI protocol based on a fast low-angle shot sequence with a navigator echo to generate cardiac triggering and respiratory gating signals retrospectively, making the use of ECG leads and respiratory motion sensors obsolete. MRI of the in vivo mouse heart using this sequence resulted in CINE images with no detectable cardiac and respiratory motion artefacts. The retrospective method allows for steady-state imaging of the mouse heart, which is essential for quantitative contrast-enhanced MRI studies. A comparison was made between prospective and retrospective methods in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio between blood and myocardial wall, as well as global cardiac functional indices: end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and ejection fraction. The retrospective method resulted in almost constant left-ventricle wall signal intensity throughout the cardiac cycle, at the expense of a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio between blood and myocardial wall as compared with the prospective method. Prospective and retrospective sequences yielded comparable global cardiac functional indices. The largest mean relative difference found was 8\% for the end-systolic volume.

Arterial stiffness is considered as an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, and is increasingly used in clinical practice. This study aimed at evaluating the consistency of the automated estimation of regional and local aortic stiffness indices from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data.


RESULTS

Forty-six healthy subjects underwent carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity measurements (CF\_PWV) by applanation tonometry and CMR with steady-state free-precession and phase contrast acquisitions at the level of the aortic arch. These data were used for the automated evaluation of the aortic arch pulse wave velocity (Arch\_PWV), and the ascending aorta distensibility (AA\_Distc, AA\_Distb), which were estimated from ascending aorta strain (AA\_Strain) combined with either carotid or brachial pulse pressure. The local ascending aorta pulse wave velocity AA\_PWVc and AA\_PWVb were estimated respectively from these carotid and brachial derived distensibility indices according to the Bramwell-Hill theoretical model, and were compared with the Arch\_PWV. In addition, a reproducibility analysis of AA\_PWV measurement and its comparison with the standard CF\_PWV was performed. Characterization according to the Bramwell-Hill equation resulted in good correlations between Arch\_PWV and both local distensibility indices AA\_Distc (r = 0.71, p {\textless} 0.001) and AA\_Distb (r = 0.60, p {\textless} 0.001); and between Arch\_PWV and both theoretical local indices AA\_PWVc (r = 0.78, p {\textless} 0.001) and AA\_PWVb (r = 0.78, p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, the Arch\_PWV was well related to CF\_PWV (r = 0.69, p {\textless} 0.001) and its estimation was highly reproducible (inter-operator variability: 7.1\%).


CONCLUSIONS

The present work confirmed the consistency and robustness of the regional index Arch\_PWV and the local indices AA\_Distc and AA\_Distb according to the theoretical model, as well as to the well established measurement of CF\_PWV, demonstrating the relevance of the regional and local CMR indices.},

	abstract = {Refocused steady-state free precession (SSFP) is limited by its high sensitivity to local field variation, particularly at high field strengths or the long repetition times (TRs) necessary for high resolution. Several methods have been proposed to reduce SSFP banding artifact by combining multiple phase-cycled SSFP acquisitions, each differing in how individual signal magnitudes and phases are combined. These include maximum-intensity SSFP (MI-SSFP) and complex-sum SSFP (CS-SSFP). The reduction in SSFP banding is accompanied by a loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. In this work a general framework for analyzing banding artifact reduction, contrast, and SNR of any multiple-acquisition SSFP combination method is presented. A new sum-of-squares method is proposed, and a comparison is performed between each of the combination schemes. The sum-of-squares SSFP technique (SOS-SSFP) delivers both robust banding artifact reduction and higher SNR efficiency than other multiple-acquisition techniques, while preserving SSFP contrast.

With these techniques, the normal mouse heart has been shown to be well suited as a model of human cardiac disease. The roles of individual genes in normal cardiac physiology have recently been studied by MR, including the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in beta-adrenergic stimulation, the roles of the inducible nitric oxide synthase and myoglobin in function, dilation, and energetics, and the role of cardiac troponin I in contractility. Furthermore, with a mouse model of myocardial infarction, the roles of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, blood coagulation factor XIII, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in post-infarct function and remodeling have been further elucidated. Non-invasive in vivo MRI and MRS in mice provide a unique and powerful means for phenotyping genetically engineered mice and can improve our understanding of the roles of specific genes and proteins in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.},

In this paper, k-space-based design of multidimensional RF pulses is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, and solved efficiently by the iterative conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm. Compared to conventional design approaches, such as the conjugate-phase (CP) method, the new design approach is beneficial in several regards. It generally produces more accurate excitation patterns. The improvement is particularly significant when k-space is undersampled, and it can potentially shorten pulse lengths. A prominent improvement in accuracy is also observed when large off-resonance gradients are present. A further boost in excitation accuracy can be accomplished in regions of interest (ROIs) if they are specified together with “don't-care” regions. The density compensation function (DCF) is no longer required. In addition, regularization techniques allow control over integrated and peak pulse power.

We propose to accelerate PC cine MRI using an approach which combines compressed sensing and parallel imaging (k-t SPARSE-SENSE). We validated the proposed 6-fold accelerated PC cine MRI against 3-fold accelerated PC cine MRI with parallel imaging (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions). With the programmable flow pump, we simulated a time varying waveform emulating hepatic blood flow. Normalized root mean square error between two sets of velocity measurements was 2.59\%. In multiple blood vessels of 12 control subjects, two sets of mean velocity measurements were in good agreement (mean difference = -0.29 cm/s; lower and upper 95\% limits of agreement = -5.26 and 4.67 cm/s, respectively). The mean phase noise, defined as the standard deviation of the phase in a homogeneous stationary region, was significantly lower for k-t SPARSE-SENSE than for generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (0.05 ± 0.01 vs. 0.19 ± 0.06 radians, respectively; P {\textless} 0.01). The proposed 6-fold accelerated PC cine MRI pulse sequence with k-t SPARSE-SENSE is a promising investigational method for rapid velocity measurement with relatively high spatial (1.7 mm × 1.7 mm) and temporal (∼35 ms) resolutions.},

Based on the assumption that artifact production by magnetic field gradient switching represents a linear time invariant process, a noise cancellation (NC) method is applied to ECG artifact linear prediction. This linear prediction is performed using a digital finite impulse response (FIR) matrix, that is computed employing ECG and gradient waveforms recorded during a training scan. The FIR filters are used during further scanning to predict artifacts by convolution of the gradient waveforms. Subtracting the artifacts from the raw ECG signal produces the correction with minimal delay. Validation of the system was performed both off-line, using prerecorded signals, and under actual examination conditions. The method is implemented using a specially designed Signal Analyzer and Event Controller (SAEC) computer and electronics. Real-time operation was demonstrated at 1 kHz with a delay of only 1 ms introduced by the processing. The system opens the possibility of automatic monitoring algorithms for electrophysiological signals in the MR environment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate interobserver and intraobserver variability in the sonographic assessment of the presence and severity of fatty liver.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the static images of 168 adult patients who had undergone abdominal sonography. Three experienced radiologists independently graded the hepatic images as normal, mild steatosis, moderate steatosis, or severe steatosis. Assessment of liver steatosis was repeated on the same set of images 1 month later under the same conditions and blinded to the initial reading. Weighted kappa statistics were used to analyze interobserver and intraobserver agreement, and the agreement percentages were calculated.
RESULTS: The mean interobserver and intraobserver agreement rates for the presence of fatty liver were 72\% (kappa = 0.43) and 76\% (kappa = 0.54). For severity of fatty liver, the initial reading for pairs of observers had 47-59\% (kappa = 0.40-0.51) interobserver agreement. The interobserver agreement for the second reading was 59-64\% (kappa = 0.43-0.54). The mean agreement rates for pairs of observers were 53\% (kappa = 0.47) and 62\% (kappa = 0.50) on the first and second readings. Intraobserver agreement for severity of fatty liver ranged from 55\% to 68\% (kappa = 0.51-0.63).
CONCLUSION: Subjective visual assessment of fatty liver on sonography has substantial observer variability. There is a need for a more objective quantitative method of grading fatty liver on sonography that would be easily available and applicable in routine clinical practice.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To assess the use of a nonrigid registration technique for semi-automatic segmentation of the aorta from real-time velocity mapping MRI.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Real-time phase contrast images were acquired to measure flow and stroke volumes in 10 subjects, during free breathing, at rest, and during exercise. A nonrigid registration algorithm was developed to propagate a manually drawn region of interest in the aorta from one frame to all other frames of the real-time sequence (148 images). Thus the technique provided a semi-automatic segmentation over the whole sequence of images. The accuracy was assessed by comparison with manual segmentations in terms of Dice overlap measures and stroke volumes (SV).


RESULTS

Semi-automatic segmentations were comparable to manual ones (Dice score of 0.89 ± 0.04). Inter-observer reproducibility was similar for manual and semi-automatic segmentations (Dice score of 0.90 ± 0.04 in both cases, the difference was not significant). SV measurements also showed good agreement between manual and semi-automatic segmentations (correlation coefficient r {\textgreater} 0.94), and the differences were not statistically significant.


CONCLUSION

Although real-time phase contrast images have compromised image quality, a fast and robust segmentation of the aorta was possible using the registration-based technique.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent advances in 4D medical imaging (4DMI) and 4D radiation therapy (4DRT), which study, characterize, and minimize patient motion during the processes of imaging and radiotherapy. Patient motion is inevitably present in these processes, producing artifacts and uncertainties in target (lesion) identification, delineation, and localization. 4DMI includes time-resolved volumetric CT, MRI, PET, PET/CT, SPECT, and US imaging. To enhance the performance of these volumetric imaging techniques, parallel multi-detector array has been employed for acquiring image projections and the volumetric image reconstruction has been advanced from the 2D to the 3D tomography paradigm. The time information required for motion characterization in 4D imaging can be obtained either prospectively or retrospectively using respiratory gating or motion tracking techniques. The former acquires snapshot projections for reconstructing a motion-free image. The latter acquires image projections continuously with an associated timestamp indicating respiratory phases using external surrogates and sorts these projections into bins that represent different respiratory phases prior to reconstructing the cyclical series of 3D images. These methodologies generally work for all imaging modalities with variations in detailed implementation. In 4D CT imaging, both multi-slice CT (MSCT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) are applicable in 4D imaging. In 4D MR imaging, parallel imaging with multi-coil-detectors has made 4D volumetric MRI possible. In 4D PET and SPECT, rigid and non-rigid motions can be corrected with aid of rigid and deformable registration, respectively, without suffering from low statistics due to signal binning. In 4D PET/CT and SPECT/CT, a single set of 4D images can be utilized for motion-free image creation, intrinsic registration, and attenuation correction. In 4D US, volumetric ultrasonography can be employed to monitor fetal heart beating with relatively high temporal resolution. 4DRT aims to track and compensate for target motion during radiation treatment, minimizing normal tissue injury, especially critical structures adjacent to the target, and/or maximizing radiation dose to the target. 4DRT requires 4DMI, 4D radiation treatment planning (4D RTP), and 4D radiation treatment delivery (4D RTD). Many concepts in 4DRT are borrowed, adapted and extended from existing image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and adaptive radiation therapy (ART). The advantage of 4DRT is its promise of sparing additional normal tissue by synchronizing the radiation beam with the moving target in real-time. 4DRT can be implemented differently depending upon how the time information is incorporated and utilized. In an ideal situation, the motion adaptive approach guided by 4D imaging should be applied to both RTP and RTD. However, until new automatic planning and motion feedback tools are developed for 4DRT, clinical implementation of ideal 4DRT will meet with limited success. However, simplified forms of 4DRT have been implemented with minor modifications of existing planning and delivery systems. The most common approach is the use of gating techniques in both imaging and treatment, so that the planned and treated target localizations are identical. In 4D planning, the use of a single planning CT image, which is representative of the statistical respiratory mean, seems preferable. In 4D delivery, on-site CBCT imaging or 3D US localization imaging for patient setup and internal fiducial markers for target motion tracking can significantly reduce the uncertainty in treatment delivery, providing improved normal tissue sparing. Most of the work on 4DRT can be regarded as a proof-of-principle and 4DRT is still in its early stage of development.},

Current technologies for CMR are time consuming and difficult to implement in clinical practice. Feature tracking is a technology that can lead to more automization and robustness of quantitative analysis of medical images with less time consumption than comparable methods., Methods: An automatic or manual input in a single phase serves as an initialization from which the system starts to track the displacement of individual patterns representing anatomical structures over time. The specialty of this method is that the images do not need to be manipulated in any way beforehand like e.g. tagging of CMR images., Results: The method is very well suited for tracking muscular tissue and with this allowing quantitative elaboration of myocardium and also blood flow., Conclusions: This new method offers a robust and time saving procedure to quantify myocardial tissue and blood with displacement, velocity and deformation parameters on regular sequences of CMR imaging. It therefore can be implemented in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Accelerated imaging is highly relevant for many CMR applications as competing constraints with respect to spatiotemporal resolution and tolerable scan times are frequently posed. Three approaches, all involving data undersampling to increase scan efficiencies, are discussed in this review. Zonal imaging can be considered a niche but nevertheless has found application in coronary imaging and CMR flow measurements. Current work on parallel-transmit systems is expected to revive the interest in zonal imaging techniques. The second and main approach to speeding up CMR sequences has been parallel imaging. A wide range of CMR applications has benefited from parallel imaging with reduction factors of two to three routinely applied for functional assessment, perfusion, viability and coronary imaging. Large coil arrays, as are becoming increasingly available, are expected to support reduction factors greater than three to four in particular in combination with 3D imaging protocols. Despite these prospects, theoretical work has indicated fundamental limits of coil encoding at clinically available magnetic field strengths. In that respect, alternative approaches exploiting prior knowledge about the object being imaged as such or jointly with parallel imaging have attracted considerable attention. Five to eight-fold scan accelerations in cine and dynamic CMR applications have been reported and image quality has been found to be favorable relative to using parallel imaging alone.With all acceleration techniques, careful consideration of the limits and the trade-off between acceleration and occurrence of artifacts that may arise if these limits are breached is required. In parallel imaging the spatially varying noise has to be considered when measuring contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios. Also, temporal fidelity in images reconstructed with prior knowledge driven methods has to be studied carefully.},

Inversion recovery (IR) provided the best tissue contrast, enabling the detection of small lesions. Flow-dependent sequences and sagittal imaging planes were particularly helpful in the evaluation of aortic aneurysms. Ferric ammonium citrate used as an oral paramagnetic contrast agent and a short T1 inversion recovery sequence gave encouraging initial results in recognising bowel loops. Gadolinium-DTPA injected intravenously provided tumour enhancement, indicating vascular perfusion and demarcating tumour margins. An attempt to eliminate motion artefacts was carried out in 15 volunteers and six patients either by a new software system (respiratory ordered phase encoding) or by using short T1 inversion-recovery to suppress the high signal from fat. The same pulse sequence results were useful in demonstrating subcutaneous fistulous tracts by eliminating the adjacent fat.

	abstract = {Background—Coronary artery bypass grafting improves survival in patients with {\textgreater}70\% luminal diameter narrowing of the 3 major epicardial coronary arteries, particularly if there is involvement of the proximal portion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Measurement of coronary flow reserve can be used to identify functionally important luminal narrowing of the LAD artery. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to visualize coronary arteries and to measure flow reserve noninvasively, the utility of MRI for detecting significant LAD stenoses is unknown.
Methods and Results—Thirty subjects (23 men, 7 women, age 36 to 77 years) underwent MRI visualization of the left main and LAD coronary arteries as well as measurement of flow in the proximal, middle, or distal LAD both at rest and after intravenous adenosine (140 μg/kg per minute). Immediately thereafter, contrast coronary angiography and when feasible, intracoronary Doppler assessments of coronary flow reserve, were performed. There was a statistically significant correlation between MRI assessments of coronary flow reserve and (a) assessments of coronary arterial stenosis severity by quantitative coronary angiography and (b) invasive measurements of coronary flow reserve (P{\textless}0.0001 for both). In comparison to computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for identifying a stenosis {\textgreater}70\% in the distal left main or proximal/middle LAD arteries was 100\% and 83\%, respectively.
Conclusions—Noninvasive MRI measures of coronary flow reserve correlated well with similar measures obtained with the use of intracoronary Doppler flow wires and predicted significant coronary stenoses ({\textgreater}70\%) with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. MRI-based measurement of coronary flow reserve may prove useful for identification of patients likely to obtain a survival benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting.},

Thus, it is feasible to acquire only a reduced amount of data and recover the missing portion afterwards. This leads to an improved temporal resolution, or an improved spatial resolution for a given amount of acquisition. Based on this approach, two methods were developed to significantly improve the performance of dynamic imaging, named k-t BLAST (Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique) and k-t SENSE (SENSitivity Encoding) for use with a single or multiple receiver coils, respectively. Signal correlations were learned from a small set of training data and the missing data were recovered using all available information in a consistent and integral manner. The general theory of k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE is applicable to arbitrary k-space trajectories, time-varying coil sensitivities, and under- and overdetermined reconstruction problems. Examples from ungated cardiac imaging demonstrate a 4-fold acceleration (voxel size 2.42 × 2.52 mm2, 38.4 fps) with either one or six receiver coils. k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE are applicable to many areas, especially those exhibiting quasiperiodic motion, such as imaging of the heart, the lungs, the abdomen, and the brain under periodic stimulation.

Today, whole volume coverage of the heart by TPM encoding at high spatial and temporal resolution is limited by long data acquisition times. Therefore, a significant increase in imaging speed without deterioration of the quantitative motion information is required. For this purpose, the k-t BLAST acceleration technique was combined with TPM black-blood functional imaging of the heart. Different k-t factors were evaluated with respect to their impact on the quantitative assessment of cardiac motion.
RESULTS: It is demonstrated that a k-t BLAST factor of two can be used with a marginal, but statistically significant deterioration of the quantitative motion data. Further increasing the k-t acceleration causes substantial alteration of the peak velocities and the motion pattern, but the temporal behavior of the contraction is well maintained up to an acceleration factor of six.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of k-t BLAST for the acceleration of TPM appears feasible. A reduction of the acquisition time of almost 45\% could be achieved without substantial loss of quantitative motion information.},

	abstract = {The spoke trajectory is often used in designing multidimensional RF pulses for applications requiring thin slice selection and in-slice modulation. Ideally, a full set of spokes covering the whole k-space are desired to generate a given excitation pattern. In practice, however, only a small number of spokes can be used due to the RF pulse length limitation. The spoke locations are, therefore, critical to the performance of the resulting RF pulse and should be in principle optimized jointly with the RF pulse for a given excitation pattern and transmit sensitivities. In this work, we formulate the joint design problem as an optimal spoke selection problem based on the small-tip-angle RF pulse design. A sequential selection based algorithm with recursive cost function evaluation is proposed to seek optimized spoke locations to minimize the excitation error. Bloch equation simulations and experimental results on a 3 Tesla scanner equipped with a two-channel parallel excitation system demonstrate that the proposed method can produce significantly smaller excitation error than conventional methods with high computational efficiency.

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To evaluate aortic elasticity with MRI on young asymptomatic individuals with mutation of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain in whom aortic enlargement is not present.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Aortic compliance, aortic distensibility, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were semiautomatically measured from MRI in 8 asymptomatic subjects having a mutation of the MYH11 gene (M+) and 21 nonmutated relatives (M-) of similar age, sex, and blood pressure characteristics.


RESULTS

Despite a similar aortic diameter in both groups, the aortic compliance and distensibility were significantly lower in M+ subjects compared with M- (0.84+/-0.33 versus 2.03+/-0.54 mm2/mmHg, 1.18+/-0.62 10(-3) versus 5.11+/-1.58 10(-3) mmHg(-1), respectively), and PWV was significantly higher (5.35+/-1.53 versus 3.60+/-0.64 m.s(-1)). A threshold aortic compliance value of 1.3 mm2/mmHg separated the two groups. The receiver operating characteristics curve analysis indicated an optimal threshold of 2.9 10(-3) mmHg(-1) for aortic distensibility (sensitivity: 87.5\%, specificity: 90\%), and of 4.4 m.s(-1) for PWV (sensitivity: 75\%, specificity: 100\%).


CONCLUSION

Young asymptomatic adults with MYH11 mutation have an aortic compliance impairment which is not detectable by the sole measurement of the aortic size. Aortic compliance measurement might be part of routine examination in patients suspected of inherited aortic disease even with a normal aortic diameter.},

The quality of the high-resolution structural data used for morphometric analysis is especially compromised by subject movement because high-resolution scans are of longer duration. A method is presented that measures and corrects rigid body motion and associated first-order shim changes in real time, using a pulse sequence with embedded cloverleaf navigators and a feedback control mechanism. The procedure requires a 12-s preliminary mapping scan. A single-path, 4.2-ms cloverleaf navigator is inserted every repetition time (TR) after the readout of a 3D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence, requiring no additional RF pulses and minimally impacting scan duration. Every TR, a rigid body motion estimate is made and a correction is fed back to adjust the gradients and shim offsets. Images are corrected and reconstructed on the scanner computer for immediate access. Correction for between-scan motion can be accomplished by using the same reference map for each scan repetition. Human and phantom tests demonstrated a consistent improvement in image quality if motion occurred during the acquisition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

While local endothelial dysfunction of conduit arteries is well recognized as an early step in atherogenesis, contradictory observations are reported with regard to alterations in the microcirculation and their association with cardiovascular risk factors (RFs). A real-time MR approach was developed to investigate the relationship between the RFs profile and microcirculatory alterations assessed as impairment of reactive hyperemic flow in the leg circulation.


METHODS

The MR technique was applied to patients (n = 17, Pats1) with 1.8 +/- 0.8 RFs but without peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD), to age-matched healthy controls (n = 13, Con1), to young controls (n = 12, 23 +/- 4 y), and to patients with RFs and PAD (n = 8, Pats2).


RESULTS

Superficial femoral artery (SFA) peak hyperemic flow in Pats1 was reduced vs Con1 (24.6 +/- 4.2 vs 30.4 +/- 7.3 mL min-1 100 mL-1 calf tissue, p {\textless} 0.02), and minimal vascular resistance increased incrementally with the number of RFs and with Framingham and Procam risk scores. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the SFA was blunted in both Pats1 and Con1 (-0.5 +/- 3.4\% and +0.6 +/- 3.2\%, respectively, both ns vs 0). In young controls, peak hyperemic flow (30.1 +/- 3.3 mL min-1. 100 mL-1) and endothelium-independent vasodilation (9.2 +/- 10.0\%) were preserved, while FMD was minimal (2.0 +/- 5.9\%,p {\textless} 0.02 vs endothelium-independent vasodilation). In Pats2, peak hyperemic flow was severely reduced (12.2 +/- 3.6 mL min-1 100 mL-1, p {\textless} 0.0003 vs Con1 and Pats1), and both FMD and endothelium-independent vasodilation were absent.


CONCLUSIONS

Reactive hyperemic flow in the SFA, reflecting microcirculatory function of the lower limb, gradually decreases with increasing cardiovascular risk suggesting a role for microvascular dysfunction in atherogenesis. The presented MR approach might become a valuable tool to study (micro)-vascular pathophysiology.},

The effect of asymmetric distributions on the accuracy of quantitative average velocity measurements is determined analytically and verified experimentally. An explicit formulation is developed for the estimated average velocity in a voxel as a function of the true average velocity and the asymmetry of the distribution about the true average velocity. Worst-case distributions are determined for unidirectional and bidirectional flow, and the special case of laminar flow is also investigated. Computer simulations and phantom imaging experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the analysis. For voxels with unidirectional flow, the phase-mapping method produces accurate estimates of average velocity, while results for bidirectional flow indicate possible large errors unless the aliasing velocity is increased, which decreases the signal-to-noise ratio in the resultant velocity map image.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Objectives. We conducted an initial clinical trial of a newly developed cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) system. We evaluated left ventricular (LV) function in 85 patients to compare the clinical utility of the CMRI system with echocardiography, the current noninvasive gold standard.

Background. Conventional CMRI systems require cardiac-gating and respiratory compensation to synthesize a single image from data acquired over multiple cardiac cycles. In contrast, the new CMRI system allows continuous real-time dynamic acquisition and display of any scan plane at 16 images/s without the need for cardiac gating or breath-holding.

Methods. A conventional 1.5T Signa MRI Scanner (GE, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was modified by the addition of an interactive workstation and a bus adapter. The new CMRI system underwent clinical trial by testing its ability to evaluate global and regional LV function. The first group (A) consisted of 31 patients with acceptable echocardiography image quality. The second group (B) consisted of 31 patients with suboptimal echocardiography image quality. The third group (C) consisted of 29 patients with severe lung disease or congenital cardiac malformation who frequently have suboptimal echo study. Two independent observers scored wall motion and image quality using the standard 16-segment model and rank-order analysis.

Results. CMRI evaluation was complete in less than 15 min. In group A, no significant difference was found between ECHO and CMRI studies (p = NS). In group B, adequate visualization of wall segments was obtained 38\% of the time using ECHO and 97\% of the time using CMRI (p \&lt; 0.0001). When grouped into coronary segments, adequate visualization of at least one segment occurred in 18 of 30 patients (60\%) with ECHO and in all 30 patients (100\%) with CMRI (p \&lt; 0.0001). In group C, adequate visualization of the wall segments was obtained in 58\% (CI 0.53–0.62) of the time using echocardiography and 99.7\% (CI 0.99–1.0) of the time using CMRI (p \&lt; 0.0001).

Conclusions. The new CMRI system provides clinically reliable evaluation of LV function and complements suboptimal echocardiography. In comparison with the conventional CMRI, the new CMRI system significantly reduces scan time, patient discomfort and associated cost.},

	abstract = {A novel method for amplitude of radiofrequency field (B1+) mapping based on the Bloch-Siegert shift is presented. Unlike conventionally applied double-angle or other signal magnitude-based methods, it encodes the B(1) information into signal phase, resulting in important advantages in terms of acquisition speed, accuracy, and robustness. The Bloch-Siegert frequency shift is caused by irradiating with an off-resonance radiofrequency pulse following conventional spin excitation. When applying the off-resonance radiofrequency in the kilohertz range, spin nutation can be neglected and the primarily observed effect is a spin precession frequency shift. This shift is proportional to the square of the magnitude of B1(2). Adding gradient image encoding following the off-resonance pulse allows one to acquire spatially resolved B(1) maps. The frequency shift from the Bloch-Siegert effect gives a phase shift in the image that is proportional to B(1)(2). The phase difference of two acquisitions, with the radiofrequency pulse applied at two frequencies symmetrically around the water resonance, is used to eliminate undesired off-resonance effects due to amplitude of static field inhomogeneity and chemical shift. In vivo Bloch-Siegert B(1) mapping with 25 sec/slice is demonstrated to be quantitatively comparable to a 21-min double-angle map. As such, this method enables robust, high-resolution B(1)(+) mapping in a clinically acceptable time frame.},

Previous approaches to RF pulse design in parallel excitation were either formulated in the frequency domain or restricted to echo-planar trajectories, or both. This paper presents an approach that is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem in the spatial domain and allows the use of arbitrary k-space trajectories. Compared to frequency domain approaches, the new design method has some important advantages. It allows for the specification of a region of interest (ROI), which improves excitation accuracy at high speedup factors. It allows for magnetic field inhomogeneity compensation during excitation. Regularization may be used to control integrated and peak pulse power. The effects of Bloch equation nonlinearity on the large-tip-angle excitation error of RF pulses designed with the method are investigated, and the utility of Tikhonov regularization in mitigating this error is demonstrated.

The hypothesis that these developments would result in a major reduction in imaging time without loss of accuracy was tested on female Wistar rats under isoflurane anesthesia. High-resolution, contiguous short-axis slices (thickness 1.5 mm) were acquired covering the entire heart. Two interleaved data sets (i) with the volume coil (eight averages) and (ii) with the four-element coil array (one average) were obtained. In addition, two-, three-, and fourfold accelerated data sets were generated through postprocessing of the coil array data, followed by a TGRAPPA reconstruction, resulting in five data sets per rat (in-plane voxel size 100 x 100 microm). Using a single blinded operator, excellent agreement was obtained between volume coil (acquisition time: 88 min) and the fourfold accelerated ({\textless}3 min) data sets (e.g., LV mass 436 +/- 21 mg vs 433 +/- 19 mg; ejection fraction 74 +/- 5\% vs 75 +/- 4\%). This finding demonstrates that it is possible to complete a rat cine-MRI study under 3 min with low variability and without losing temporal or spatial resolution, making high throughput screening programs feasible.},

The complexity of tissue shapes of interest and the desire to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing partial-volume effects require more sophisticated localization techniques. A group of spatially selective RF pulses are proposed in this work for the measurement of spectra from regions of arbitrary shape based on using a radial trajectory in k-space. Utilizing a single k-line per excitation results in a broad spectroscopic bandwidth. However, spatial localization accuracy is compromised for nutation angles {\textgreater} 10° because of the small-tip-angle approximation of the Bloch equations. By interleaving multiple radial k-lines per excitation with nonselective refocusing pulses, one can achieve accurate localization for nutation angles up to 90° while simultaneously maintaining the spectral bandwidth. The technique is described and compared with existing localization methods, and in vivo results are demonstrated. Magn Reson Med 58:19–26, 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The temporal resolution of the corresponding pulse sequences plays an important role concerning the potential of the method to fully detect time resolved flow or motion patterns. A further improvement of temporal or spatial resolution in phase contrast CINE MRI can be achieved by the application of view sharing. Based on simulations with point-spread-functions resulting from different cyclic flow or motion patterns an analysis of view sharing techniques in combination with phase contrast MRI is presented. Velocity mapping properties and the role of different k-space regions concerning the resulting values in the phase images and thus encoded velocities were investigated. It could be shown that the velocity induced phase shifts in phase contrast techniques are mainly encoded in the central sections of k-space which makes view sharing also suitable for velocity mapping. As a result the use of appropriate sampling and data acquisition schemes permits the assessment of flow or motion patterns with significantly improved temporal resolution without loss of functional information. In addition phantom measurements with an oscillation phantom were performed in order to validate the simulation results and to demonstrate the potential of view sharing techniques to accelerate phase contrast imaging and improve the detection of the underlying flow or motion dynamics.},

A fully automatic segmentation method based on active contour model algorithms for defining vessel boundaries has been developed. For segmentation, the phase image, in addition to the magnitude image, is used to address image distortions frequently seen in the magnitude image of disturbed flow fields. A modified definition for the active contour model is introduced to reduce the influence of missing or spurious edge information of the vessel wall. The method was evaluated on flow phantom data and on in vivo images acquired in the ascending aorta of humans. Phantom experiments resulted in an error of 0.8\% in assessing the luminal area of a flow phantom equipped with an artificial heart valve. Blinded evaluation of the volume flow rates from automatic vs. manual segmentation of gradient echo (FFE) phase contrast images obtained in vivo resulted in a mean difference of -0.9 +/- 3\%. The mean difference from automatic vs. manual segmentation of images acquired with a hybrid phase contrast sequence (TFEPI) within a single breath-hold was -0.9 +/- 6\%.},

To acquire such images with reasonable temporal resolution, a single-shot acquisition should be used because of the inherently long TR needed for T2 weighting. Unfortunately, most scanners require long readout times (eg, greater than 150 msec) and high bandwidths (eg, greater than 120 kHz) to perform conventional single-shot imaging with high spatial resolution. The resulting images are thus degraded by unacceptable artifacts and noise levels. This study illustrates how to create locally focused MR images that have high spatial resolution in a region of interest and lower spatial resolution elsewhere in the image. Because these images can be created from sparse k-space data, a scanner with modest gradients (eg, 10 mT/m maximal amplitude, 500 μsec minimal rise time) can acquire them after a single excitation with relatively short readout time and low bandwidth. This technique may make it practical to monitor interventions with T2-weighted imaging. The method was illustrated by reconstructing dynamic changes, which were simulated experimentally by moving objects in the vicinity of a normal human head.},

Although dual-inversion recovery is currently the gold standard, optimal lumen-to-vessel wall contrast is sometimes difficult to obtain, and the time window available for imaging is limited due to competing requirements between blood signal nulling time and period of minimal myocardial motion. Further, atherosclerosis is a spatially heterogeneous disease, and imaging at multiple anatomic levels of the coronary circulation is mandatory. However, this requirement of enhanced volumetric coverage comes at the expense of scanning time. Phase-sensitive inversion recovery has shown to be very valuable for enhancing tissue-tissue contrast and for making inversion recovery imaging less sensitive to tissue signal nulling time. This work enables multislice black-blood coronary vessel wall imaging in a single breath hold by extending phase-sensitive inversion recovery to phase-sensitive dual-inversion recovery, by combining it with spiral imaging and yet relaxing constraints related to blood signal nulling time and period of minimal myocardial motion.},

	abstract = {Dynamic MRI is restricted due to the time required to obtain enough data to reconstruct the image sequence. Several undersampled reconstruction techniques have been proposed to reduce the acquisition time. In most of these techniques the nonacquired data are recovered by modeling the temporal information as varying pixel intensities represented in time or in temporal frequencies. Here we propose a new approach that recovers the missing data through a motion estimation of the object elements (“obels,” or pieces of tissue) of the image. This method assumes that an obel displacement through the sequence has lower bandwidth than fluctuations in pixel intensities caused by the motion, and thus it can be modeled with fewer parameters. Preliminary results show that this technique can effectively reconstruct (with root mean square (RMS) errors below 4\%) cardiac images and joints with undersampling factors of 8 and 4, respectively. Moreover, in the reconstruction process an approximation of the motion vectors is obtained for each obel, which can be used to quantify dynamic information. In this method the motion need not be confined to a part of the field of view (FOV) or to a portion of the temporal frequency. It is appropriate for dynamic studies in which the obels' motion model has fewer parameters than the number of acquired samples. Magn Reson Med 57:939–949, 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

MR measurements of cardiac output are significantly depressed during breath-holding at deep inspiration, but the advantage is that the breath-hold method requires less scan time. Blood flow in the coronary sinus reflects the global myocardial blood flow because it represents approximately 96\% of the total myocardial blood flow of the left ventricle (LV). If blood flow in the coronary sinus is measured with phase-contrast cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and LV myocardial mass is measured with cine MRI, both the total myocardial blood flow and the average coronary blood flow per gram of myocardial mass can be quantified. Coronary flow reserve with volumetric MR flow measurement is measured to be within 4.2-5.0-fold. The noninvasive MR measurement of coronary flow reserve has been shown to be useful in identifying the functional significance of stenoses in the left anterior descending artery. The sensitivity and specificity of MR coronary flow velocity reserve for identifying stenosis of 70\% or greater in the left main or left anterior descending artery were 100\% and 83\%, respectively.

In humans, measurements of cardiac function made using cine-MRI compare favourably with those made using echocardiography. However, no rigorous comparison has been made in small animals. Here, standard short-axis two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (2D-echo) and cine-MRI measurements were made in the same rats, both control and after chronic myocardial infarction. Correlations between the two techniques were found for end diastolic area, stroke area and ejection fraction, but cine-MRI measurements of ejection fraction were 12 ± 6\% higher than those made using 2D-echo, because of the 1.8-fold higher temporal resolution of the MRI technique (4.6 ms vs 8.3 ms). Repeated measurements on the same group of rats over several days showed that the cine-MRI technique was more reproducible than 2D-echo, in that 2D-echo would require five times more animals to find a statistically significant difference. In summary, caution should be exercised when comparing functional results acquired using short-axis 2D-echo vs cine-MRI. The accuracy of cine-MRI allows identification of alterations in heart function that may be missed when using 2D-echo. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, MRI of small rodents puts high demands on the sensitivity of data acquisition. This requirement can be addressed by using cryogenic radio-frequency (RF) detection devices. The aim of this work was to investigate the in vivo performance of a 400 MHz cryogenic transmit/receive RF probe (CryoProbe) designed for MRI of the mouse brain. To characterize this novel probe, MR data sets were acquired with both the CryoProbe and a matched conventional receive-only surface coil operating at room temperature (RT) using conventional acquisition protocols (gradient and spin echo) with identical parameter settings. Quantitative comparisons in phantom and in vivo experiments revealed gains in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2.4 and 2.5, respectively. The increased sensitivity of the CryoProbe was invested to enhance the image quality of high resolution structural images acquired in scan times compatible with routine operation ({\textless} 45 min). In high resolution (30 x 30 x 300 microm(3)) structural images of the mouse cerebellum, anatomical details such as Purkinje cell and molecular layers could be identified. Similarly, isotropic (60 x 60 x 60 microm(3)) imaging of mouse cortical and subcortical areas revealed anatomical structures smaller than 100 microm. Finally, 3D MR angiography (52 x 80 x 80 microm(3)) of the brain vasculature enabled the detailed reconstruction of intracranial vessels (anterior and middle cerebral artery). In conclusion, this low temperature detection device represents an attractive option to increase the performance of small animal MR systems operating at 9.4 Tesla.},

To evaluate differences in velocity and flow measurements in the aorta between accelerated phase-contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using SENSE and k-t BLAST and in peak velocity to Doppler ultrasound.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two-dimensional PC-MRI perpendicular to the ascending and descending aorta was performed in 11 volunteers using SENSE (R = 2) and k-t BLAST (2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-fold). Peak velocity, mean velocity, and stroke volume of the accelerated PC-MRI experiments were correlated. Peak velocities were compared to Doppler ultrasound.


RESULTS

All acceleration techniques showed significant correlations for peak velocity with Doppler ultrasound. However, k-t BLAST 6 and 8 showed a significant underestimation. Strong correlations between SENSE and k-t BLAST were found for all three parameters. Significant differences in peak velocity were found between SENSE and all k-t BLAST experiments, but not for 2-fold k-t BLAST in the ascending aorta, and 2- and 4-fold k-t BLAST in the descending aorta. For mean velocity no significant differences were found. Stroke volume showed significant differences for all k-t BLAST experiments in the ascending and for 6- and 8-fold k-t BLAST in the descending aorta.


CONCLUSION

Peak velocity of accelerated PC-MRI correlated with CW Doppler measurements, but high k-t BLAST acceleration factors lead to a significant underestimation. SENSE with R = 2 and 2-fold k-t BLAST are most highly correlated in phase-contrast flow measurements.},

The method consists of a new active contour model that tries to maintain a constant contour environment by matching gray values in profiles perpendicular to the contour. Consequently, the contours should maintain a constant position with respect to neighboring anatomical structures, such that the resulting contours reflect the preferences of the user. This is particularly important in cine cardiac magnetic resonance images because local image features do not describe the desired contours near the papillary muscle. The accuracy of the propagation result is influenced by several parameters. Because the optimal setting of these parameters is application dependent, we describe how to use full factorial experiments to optimize the parameter setting. We have applied our method to cine cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences from the long axis two-chamber view, the long axis four-chamber view, and the short axis view. We performed our optimization procedure for each contour in each view. Next, we performed an extensive clinical validation of our method on 69 short axis data sets and 38 long axis data sets. In the optimal parameter setting, our propagation method proved to be fast, robust, and accurate. The resulting cardiac contours are positioned within the interobserver ranges of manual segmentation. Consequently, the resulting contours can be used to accurately determine physiological parameters such as stroke volume and ejection fraction.},

Even though, the chick embryo has long been used as a model for cardiovascular research, MRI has not yet been used for in vivo cardiac studies. Part of the reason for this is the difficulty in monitoring the ECG and respiration of the chick embryo in the magnet for gating purposes. To overcome this complication, this paper presents the use of retrospective Cine MRI to measure the cardiac function of chick embryos in ovo for the first time, without the need for respiratory or cardiac gating. The resulting left ventricular functional parameters, from six chick embryos at 20 days of incubation, were (mean ± SD) EDV 69 ± 15 µL, ESV 31 ± 7 µL, SV 38 ± 9 µL and EF 54.5 ± 2\%.

The classical approaches for this goal include parallel imaging, temporal filtering and their combinations. Recently, model-based reconstruction methods called k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE have been proposed which largely overcome the drawbacks of the conventional dynamic imaging methods without a priori knowledge of the spectral support. Another recent approach called k-t SPARSE also does not require exact knowledge of the spectral support. However, unlike k-t BLAST/SENSE, k-t SPARSE employs the so-called compressed sensing (CS) theory rather than using training. The main contribution of this paper is a new theory and algorithm that unifies the above mentioned approaches while overcoming their drawbacks. Specifically, we show that the celebrated k-t BLAST/SENSE are the special cases of our algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal from the CS theory perspective. Experimental results show that the new algorithm can successfully reconstruct a high resolution cardiac sequence and functional MRI data even from severely limited k-t samples, without incurring aliasing artifacts often observed in conventional methods.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To assess the feasibility of using a two-dimensional partial Fourier (PF) reconstruction scheme to reduce the acquisition time of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of coronary arteries.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Symmetric k-space data sets of coronary arteries were collected in seven volunteers using a three-dimensional breath-hold steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence. Partial, asymmetric k-space data sets were generated by removing 25\% of the data in the readout direction and 25\% of the data in the phase encoding direction. The missing data were then estimated using a two-dimensional projection-onto-convex-sets (POCS) algorithm or filled with zeroes. Images were reconstructed from the full data set, the PF data set, and the zero-filled (ZF) data set, respectively. Coronary artery sharpness was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively.


RESULTS

Coronary artery sharpness in PF images was comparable to that in full k-space images and significantly better than that in ZF images.


CONCLUSION

Two-dimensional POCS PF reconstruction is a potentially useful technique for reducing acquisition time or improving spatial resolution for breath-hold coronary MR angiography.},

	abstract = {Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) using multichannel receiver coils has emerged as an effective tool to reduce imaging time in various applications. However, the issue of accurate estimation of coil sensitivities has not been fully addressed, which limits the level of speed enhancement achievable with the technology. The self-calibrating (SC) technique for sensitivity extraction has been well accepted, especially for dynamic imaging, and complements the common calibration technique that uses a separate scan. However, the existing method to extract the sensitivity information from the SC data is not accurate enough when the number of data is small, and thus erroneous sensitivities affect the reconstruction quality when they are directly applied to the reconstruction equation. This paper considers this problem of error propagation in the sequential procedure of sensitivity estimation followed by image reconstruction in existing methods, such as sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH), and reformulates the image reconstruction problem as a joint estimation of the coil sensitivities and the desired image, which is solved by an iterative optimization algorithm. The proposed method was tested on various data sets. The results from a set of in vivo data are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when a rather large net acceleration factor is used.

	abstract = {This article describes a general framework for multiple coil MRI reconstruction in the presence of elastic physiological motion. On the assumption that motion is known or can be predicted, it is shown that the reconstruction problem is equivalent to solving an integral equation—known in the literature as a Fredholm equation of the first kind—with a generalized kernel comprising Fourier and coil sensitivity encoding, modified by physiological motion information. Numerical solutions are found using an iterative linear system solver. The different steps in the numerical resolution are discussed, in particular it is shown how over-determination can be used to improve the conditioning of the generalized encoding operator. Practical implementation requires prior knowledge of displacement fields, so a model of patient motion is described which allows elastic displacements to be predicted from various input signals (e.g., respiratory belts, ECG, navigator echoes), after a free-breathing calibration scan. Practical implementation was demonstrated with a moving phantom setup and in two free-breathing healthy subjects, with images from the thoracic-abdominal region. Results show that the method effectively suppresses the motion blurring/ghosting artifacts, and that scan repetitions can be used as a source of over-determination to improve the reconstruction.

First, the central vessel axis is obtained using path tracking between three user-defined points. Second, starting from this path, the segmentation is automatically obtained using a level set. The cost and speed functions for path tracking and segmentation make use of intensity and homogeneity slice-based image features. The method is validated on a large data set of 234 carotid bifurcations of 129 ischemic stroke patients with atherosclerotic disease. The results are compared to manually obtained lumen segmentations. Parameter optimization is carried out on a subset of 30 representative carotid bifurcations. With the optimized parameter settings the method successfully tracked the central vessel paths in 201 of the remaining 204 bifurcations (99\%) which were not part of the training set. Comparison with manually drawn segmentations shows that the average overlap between the method and observers is similar (for the inter-observer set the results were 92\% vs. 87\% and for the intra-observer set 94\% vs. 94\%). Therefore the method has potential to replace the manual procedure of lumen segmentation of the atherosclerotic bifurcation in CTA.},

Real-time filtering of navigator data without delay, as opposed to the previously used retrospective frequency band filtering, is required for effective prospective navigator gating.

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging-guided high intensity focused ultrasound is a promising method for the noninvasive ablation of pathological tissue in abdominal organs such as liver and kidney. Due to the high perfusion rates of these organs, sustained sonications are required to achieve a sufficiently high temperature elevation to induce necrosis. However, the constant displacement of the target due to the respiratory cycle render continuous ablations challenging, since dynamic repositioning of the focal point is required. This study demonstrates subsecond 3D high intensity focused ultrasound-beam steering under magnetic resonance-guidance for the real-time compensation of respiratory motion. The target is observed in 3D space by coupling rapid 2D magnetic resonance-imaging with prospective slice tracking based on pencil-beam navigator echoes. The magnetic resonance-data is processed in real-time by a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline, which provides the position, the temperature and the thermal dose on-the-fly, and which feeds corrections into the high intensity focused ultrasound-ablator. The effect of the residual update latency is reduced by using a 3D Kalman-predictor for trajectory anticipation. The suggested method is characterized with phantom experiments and verified in vivo on porcine kidney. The results show that for update frequencies of more than 10 Hz and latencies of less then 114 msec, temperature elevations can be achieved, which are comparable to static experiments.},

	abstract = {The value of phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging for quantifying tissue motion and blood flow has been long recognized. However, the sensitivity of the method to system imperfections can lead to inaccuracies limiting its clinical acceptance. A key source of error relates to eddy current-induced phase fluctuations, which can offset the measured object velocity significantly. A higher-order dynamic field camera was used to study the spatiotemporal evolution of background phases in cine phase-contrast measurements. It is demonstrated that eddy current-induced offsets in phase-difference data are present up to the second spatial order. Oscillatory temporal behaviors of offsets in the kHz range suggest mechanical resonances of the MR system to be non-negligible in phase-contrast imaging. By careful selection of the echo time, their impact can be significantly reduced. When applying field monitoring data for correcting eddy current and mechanically induced velocity offsets, errors decrease to less than 0.5\% of the maximum velocity for various sequence settings proving the robustness of the correction approach. In vivo feasibility is demonstrated for aortic and pulmonary flow measurements in five healthy subjects. Using field monitoring data, mean error in stroke volume was reduced from 10\% to below 3\%.

Unfortunately, we can only measure the final phase of the spins: the rotation is wrapped into the range [−π, +π], and to obtain a measure of the parameter of interest the missing multiples of 2π must be replaced—a process known as phase unwrapping. While simple in principle, standard phase unwrapping algorithms fail catastrophically in the presence of even small amounts of noise. Here we present a new algorithm for robust three-dimensional phase unwrapping, in which unwrapping is guided, so that it initially works on less noisy regions. We test the algorithm on simulated phase data, and on maps of magnetic field, which were then used to successfully undistort EPI images.

	abstract = {The multitude of applications offered by CMR make it an increasing popular modality to study the heart and the surrounding vessels. Nevertheless the anatomical complexity of the chest, together with cardiac and respiratory motion, and the fast flowing blood, present many challenges which can possibly translate into imaging artefacts. The literature is wide in terms of papers describing specific MR artefacts in great technical detail. In this review we attempt to summarise, in a language accessible to a clinical readership, some of the most common artefacts found in CMR applications. It begins with an introduction of the most common pulse sequences, and imaging techniques, followed by a brief section on typical cardiovascular applications. This leads to the main section on common CMR artefacts with examples, a short description of the mechanisms behind them, and possible solutions.

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To validate the technique of partial k-space sampling and zero filling with phase-contrast flow measurements as compared to measurements with full k-space sampling.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

In vitro: A laminar flow phantom was utilized to evaluate the effect of partial k-space sampling on the accuracy, precision and signal-to-noise ratio of phase-contrast flow measurements. In vivo: The effect of partial k-space sampling on the quantification of cardiac output (n = 40 patients) and the duration of the scan were evaluated in the ascending aorta (n = 37) and pulmonary trunk (n = 34) in a prospective study.


RESULTS

Partial k-space sampling resulted in an increase in the SNR by 2 \% in vitro. The precision was altered by less than 1 \%. Flow volumes were systematically overestimated by 3.5 \%. No significant differences were found in the in vivo measurements of cardiac output. The scan duration was reduced by 34 \% by utilizing partial k-space sampling.


CONCLUSION

Partial k-space sampling can be used to reduce scan time without a significant decrease in the accuracy or precision of phase-contrast flow measurements in large arteries.},

	abstract = {Balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) techniques provide excellent contrast between myocardium and blood at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hence, SSFP imaging has become the method of choice for assessing cardiac function at 1.5T. The expected improvement in SNR at higher field strength prompted us to implement SSFP at 3.0T. In this work, an optimized sequence protocol for cardiac SSFP imaging at 3.0T is derived, taking into account several partly adverse effects at higher field, such as increased field inhomogeneities, longer T1, and power deposition limitations. SSFP contrast is established by optimizing the maximum amplitude of the radiofrequency (RF) field strength for shortest TR, as well as by localized linear or second-order shimming and local optimization of the resonance frequency. Given the increased SNR, sensitivity encoding (SENSE) can be employed to shorten breath-hold times. Short-axis, long-axis, and four-chamber cine views obtained in healthy adult subjects are presented, and three different types of artifacts are discussed along with potential methods for reducing them.

The resolving power which was attained was sufficiently high to allow a measurement of the fine structure of the zero moment peaks. From the separation of the two m=-3 peaks and the diamagnetic susceptibility, we calculate the moment of indium 115 to be 6.40±0.20 nuclear magnetons. From the theory of this effect which is given below, it is clear that this value does not depend on any assumption with regard to the interaction between the nuclear spin and the electron configuration. Peaks arising from the metastable 2P3/2 state, lying 2212.6 cm-1 above the 2P1/2 state were found. The intensity of these peaks is in good agreement with what is expected from quantum statistics.

Although an inherent loss of SNR in parallel MRI is inevitable due to the reduced measurement time, the sensitivity to image artifacts that result from severe undersampling can be ameliorated by alternative reconstruction methods. While the introduction of GRAPPA and SENSE extended MRI reconstructions from a simple unitary transformation (Fourier transform) to the inversion of an ill-conditioned linear system, the next logical step is the use of a nonlinear inversion. Here, a respective algorithm based on a Newton-type method with appropriate regularization terms is demonstrated to improve the performance of autocalibrating parallel MRI—mainly due to a better estimation of the coil sensitivity profiles. The approach yields images with considerably reduced artifacts for high acceleration factors and/or a low number of reference lines. Magn Reson Med, 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Yet, the highly convoluted form of the human V1 has thus far prevented the performance of MRS investigations that are spatially confined within the gray matter of this area. Typically, these studies are compromised by partial volume contaminations originating from white matter tissue, cerebrospinal fluid and other cortical areas. In this study, was exploited the relative flatness of V1 in macaques to enable single-voxel 1H-MRS from a small volume (5 x 1.6 x 5 mm3, 40 microl) that was entirely confined within the V1 gray matter of anesthetized monkeys. Linewidths of 13.5+/-1.9 Hz and 13.0+/-1.3 Hz for water and creatine, respectively, were achieved with a two-step shimming strategy for voxels at the brain surface. The quality of the obtained results paves the way for further neuroscientific research, including studies on the cortical microcircuits and the dynamic longitudinal changes occurring during cortical reorganization and plasticity.},

By exploiting the multichannel nature of the problem, where multiple acquisitions of the same image function are obtained with different sensitivity weightings, we obtain a subspace-based framework for directly solving for the sensitivity functions. The proposed approach does not rely on the sum-of-squares assumption used in existing estimation schemes; this assumption tends to be violated towards the center of the image, thus leading to errors in the sensitivity estimates. Our approach eliminates this problem, producing superior sensitivity estimates in comparison to the sum-of-squares technique. In addition, the proposed restoration procedure is non-iterative, computationally efficient, and applicable both to cases where pilot scans are available or where auto-calibration data are collected with each scan.

This is important since the degree of stenosis within arteries is commonly assessed from the maximum velocity. A string phantom was used as the source of Doppler signals. This enables direct comparison between the Doppler estimated maximum velocity and the true filament velocity. Six modern commercial Doppler systems were used. Measurements were made under standard conditions for each probe. In addition a number of factors were varied in turn (beam–filament angle, filament depth, filament velocity and Doppler aperture position). Under standard conditions the maximum velocity was overestimated in all cases (0–29\% error). For all measurements maximum velocity errors ranged from –4\% to 47\% There was a large intraprobe variation in maximum velocity estimation (mean variation of 25\%), and a large interprobe variation (mean variation of 18\%). These results indicate that, at present, errors in maximum velocity estimation may be directly translated into significant errors in the estimate of the degree of arterial stenosis made from velocity measurements. As a consequence, some patients may be incorrectly categorized. Consideration should be given to applying angle dependent correction factors to maximum velocity measurements, and to the use of conversion from Doppler frequency shift to velocity using the angle derived from the edge of the Doppler aperture.},

Mechanical diastolic duration (MDD) is comprised by the phases of early rapid filling (E wave), diastasis, and late atrial filling (A wave). The effect of heart rate (HR) on diastolic duration is predictable from kinematic modeling and known cellular physiology. To determine the dependence of MDD of each phase and the velocity time integral (VTI) on HR, simultaneous transmitral Doppler flow velocities and ECG were recorded during supine bicycle exercise in healthy volunteers. Durations, peak values, and VTI using triangular approximation for E- and A-wave shape were measured. MDD, defined as the interval from the start of the E wave to end of the A wave, was fit as an algebraic function of HR by MDD = BMDD + MLMDD·HR + MIMDD/HR, derivable from first principles, where BMDD is a constant, and MLMDD and MIMDD are the constant coefficients of the linear and inverse HR dependent terms. Excellent correlation was observed (r2 = 0.98). E- and A-wave durations were found to be very nearly independent of HR: 100\% increase in HR generated only an 18\% decrease in E-wave duration and 16\% decrease in A-wave duration. VTI was similarly very nearly independent of HR. Diastasis duration closely tracked MDD as a function of HR. We conclude that the elimination of diastasis and merging of E and A waves of nearly fixed durations primarily govern changes in MDD. These observations support the perspective that E- and A-wave durations are primarily governed by the rules of mechanical oscillation that are minimally HR dependent.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

To evaluate the effect of field strength on flow-sensitive 4D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic aorta. A volunteer study at 1.5 T and 3 T was conducted to compare phase-contrast MR angiography (MRA) and 3D flow visualization quality as well as quantification of aortic hemodynamics.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ten healthy volunteers were examined by flow-sensitive 4D MRI at both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI with identical imaging parameters (TE/TR = 6/5.1 msec, spatial/temporal resolution ≈2 mm/40.8 msec). Analysis included assessment of image quality of derived aortic 3D phase contrast (PC) angiography and 3D flow visualization (semiquantitative grading on a 0-2 scale, two blinded observers) and quantification of blood flow velocities, net flow per cardiac cycle, wall shear stress (WSS), and velocity noise.


RESULTS

Quality of 3D blood flow visualization (average grading = 1.8 ± 0.4 at 3 T vs. 1.1 ± 0.7 at 1.5 T) and the depiction of aortic lumen geometry by 3D PC-MRA (1.7 ± 0.5 vs. 1.2 ± 0.6) were significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) improved at 3 T while velocity noise was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.01) at 1.5 T. Velocity quantification resulted in minimally altered (0.05 m/s, 3 mL/cycle and 0.01 N/m(2) ) but not statistically different (P = 0.40, P = 0.39, and P = 0.82) systolic peak velocities, net flow, and WSS for 1.5 T compared to 3 T.


CONCLUSION

Flow-sensitive 4D MRI at 3 T provided improved image quality without additional artifacts related to higher fields. Imaging at 1.5 T MRI, which is more widely available, was also feasible and provided information on aortic 3D hemodynamics of moderate quality with identical performance regarding quantitative analysis.

The correlation between the right ventricular paced QT interval and the left ventricular systolic interval is not known. The aim of our study was to collect data on the correlation between QT and systolic and diastolic indexes at different heart rates in patients with dual-chamber rate-responsive pacemakers.
Method and results The study involved 13 patients [67 ± 9 years; ejection fraction (EF) 52 ± 10\%] with standard indication for dual-chamber pacing. Patients were evaluated at rest in the supine position. The AV delay was set at 130 ms, and the pacing rate was increased from 90 to 130 bpm (10 bpm steps for 3 min). At the end of each 3 min step, QT intervals were automatically evaluated in real time by means of pacemaker telemetry. We also evaluated heart performance by means of echo-2D (end-diastolic/end-systolic volumes, EF) and echo-Doppler measurements [left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and diastolic filling time (LVDFT), aortic velocity time integral, and systolic volume] and systemic arterial pressure. The QT interval progressively decreased from 330 ± 20 to 280 ± 10 ms as the pacing rate was increased from 90 to 130 bpm. The correlation between the QT interval and LVET as a function of the pacing rate was R2 = 0.966, indicating a good and relatively parallel trend in these two parameters. The correlation between RR-QT (reflecting electrical diastole) and LVDFT (reflecting mechanical diastole) was R2 = 0.975. The index LVET/QT (ratio between mechanical and electrical systole) was constant in the range 90–120 bpm, but significantly decreased at 130 bpm: the mechanical LVET shortens more than the electrical QT does at the highest heart rates.
Conclusion In paced patients at rest and during artificially increased heart rates, QT interval dynamics is closely correlated with changes in ejection time, thus constituting an electrical parameter of systolic time. A similar correlation exists between RR-QT, as a diastolic electrical interval, and the DFT.},

Respiratory gated phase contrast measurements with 3-directional velocity encoding were performed in 12 healthy volunteers in basal, midventricular, and apical locations of the left ventricle during free breathing with a temporal resolution of 13.8 ms. Results were compared to standard breath-hold measurements with a temporal resolution of 69 ms. Data from the high temporal resolution study revealed details in left ventricular motion patterns that were previously not seen in phase contrast measurements and are only known from echocardiography.

Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain–for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.

	abstract = {Abstract 
The partial separability (PS) of spatiotemporal signals has been exploited to accelerate dynamic cardiac MRI by sampling two datasets (training and imaging datasets) without breath-holding or ECG triggering. According to the theory of partially separable functions, the wider the range of spatial frequency components covered by the training dataset, the more accurate the temporal constraint imposed by the PS model. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new sampling scheme for the PS model in order to cover a wider range of spatial frequency components. In this paper, we propose the use of radial sampling trajectories for collecting the training dataset and Cartesian sampling trajectories for collecting the imaging dataset. In vivo high resolution cardiac MRI experiments demonstrate that the proposed data sampling scheme can significantly improve the image quality. The image quality using the PS model with the proposed sampling scheme is comparable to that of a commercial method using retrospective cardiac gating and breath-holding. The success of this study demonstrates great potential for high-quality, high resolution dynamic cardiac MRI without ECG gating or breath-holding through use of the PS model and the novel data sampling scheme.},

The modified method allowed a full factor of two savings in time with much better coverage of the central k-space information and, because of this, smaller reconstruction artifacts. The residual magnitude error was found to correlate strongly with the residual phase error. Numerical simulation also indicated that with a priori perfect phase information, the original magnitude image could be perfectly reconstructed with half of the k-space data points in the multi-dimensional case. Simulated, phantom, and human data sets were tested with edge differences ranging from 10\% (consistent with variable Gibbs ringing) to 25\% (consistent with a blurred version of the object). The method was found to be a valuable adjunct to human imaging for short TR, T1-weighted three-dimensional gradient-echo imaging and magnetic resonance (MR) angiographic methods, especially when short echo times were used.

The performance of different reconstruction strategies was evaluated using data sets with different ratios of phase (Ny) and partition (Nz) encoding lines (Ny × Nz = 64–128 × 40–64) acquired in a moving phantom. Image reconstruction was performed for different kernel configurations and different reduction factors (R = 5, 6, 8, and 10) and was evaluated using regional error quantification and SNR analysis. To analyze the temporal fidelity of the different kernel configurations in vivo, time-resolved 3D phase contrast data were acquired in the thoracic aorta of two healthy volunteers. Results demonstrated that kernel configurations with a small kernel extension yielded superior results especially for more asymmetric data matrices as typically used in clinical applications. The application of k-t-GRAPPA to in vivo data demonstrated the feasibility of undersampling of time-resolved 3D phase contrast data set with a nominal reduction factors of up to Rnet = 8, while maintaining the temporal fidelity of the measured velocity field. Extended GRAPPA-based parallel imaging with optimized multidimensional reconstruction kernels has the potential to substantially accelerate data acquisitions in time-resolved 3D MRI.

	abstract = {First-pass cardiac perfusion MRI is a natural candidate for compressed sensing acceleration since its representation in the combined temporal Fourier and spatial domain is sparse and the required incoherence can be effectively accomplished by k-t random undersampling. However, the required number of samples in practice (three to five times the number of sparse coefficients) limits the acceleration for compressed sensing alone. Parallel imaging may also be used to accelerate cardiac perfusion MRI, with acceleration factors ultimately limited by noise amplification. In this work, compressed sensing and parallel imaging are combined by merging the k-t SPARSE technique with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction to substantially increase the acceleration rate for perfusion imaging. We also present a new theoretical framework for understanding the combination of k-t SPARSE with SENSE based on distributed compressed sensing theory. This framework, which identifies parallel imaging as a distributed multisensor implementation of compressed sensing, enables an estimate of feasible acceleration for the combined approach. We demonstrate feasibility of 8-fold acceleration in vivo with whole-heart coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution using standard coil arrays. The method is relatively insensitive to respiratory motion artifacts and presents similar temporal fidelity and image quality when compared to Generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) with 2-fold acceleration.

	abstract = {To determine whether left ventricular (LV) end systole and end ejection uncouple in patients with long-term mitral regurgitation, 59 patients (22 control patients with atypical chest pain, 21 patients with aortic regurgitation, and 16 patients with mitral regurgitation) were studied with micromanometer LV catheters and radionuclide angiograms. End systole was defined as the time of occurrence (Tmax) of the maximum time-varying elastance (Emax), and end ejection was defined as the time of occurrence of minimum ventricular volume (minV) and zero systolic flow as approximated by the aortic dicrotic notch (Aodi). The temporal relation between end systole and end ejection in the control patients was Tmax (331 +/- 42 [SD] msec), minV (336 +/- 36 msec), and then, zero systolic flow (355 +/- 23 msec). This temporal relation was maintained in the patients with aortic regurgitation. In contrast, in the patients with mitral regurgitation, the temporal relation was Tmax (266 +/- 49 msec), zero systolic flow (310 +/- 37 msec, p less than 0.01 vs. Tmax), and then, minV (355 +/- 37 msec, p less than 0.001 vs. Tmax and p less than 0.01 vs. Aodi). Additionally, the average Tmax occurred earlier in the patients with mitral regurgitation than in the control patients and patients with aortic regurgitation (p less than 0.01, for both), whereas the average time to minimum ventricular volume was similar in all three patient groups. Moreover, the average time to zero systolic flow also occurred earlier in the patients with mitral regurgitation than in the control patients (p less than 0.01) and patients with aortic regurgitation (p less than 0.05). Because of the dissociation of end systole from minimum ventricular volume in the patients with mitral regurgitation, the end-ejection pressure-volume relations calculated at minimum ventricular volume did not correlate (r = -0.09), whereas those calculated at zero systolic flow did correlate (r = 0.88) with the Emax slope values. We conclude that end ejection, defined as minimum ventricular volume, dissociates from end systole in patients with mitral regurgitation because of the shortened time to LV end systole in association with preservation of the time to LV end ejection due to the low impedance to ejection presented by the left atrium. Therefore, pressure-volume relations calculated at minimum ventricular volume might not be useful for assessing LV chamber performance in some patients with mitral regurgitation.},

We validated the proposed 6-fold accelerated PC cine MRI against 3-fold accelerated PC cine MRI with parallel imaging (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions). With the programmable flow pump, we simulated a time varying waveform emulating hepatic blood flow. Normalized root mean square error between two sets of velocity measurements was 2.59\%. In multiple blood vessels of 12 control subjects, two sets of mean velocity measurements were in good agreement (mean difference = -0.29 cm/s; lower and upper 95\% limits of agreement = -5.26 and 4.67 cm/s, respectively). The mean phase noise, defined as the standard deviation of the phase in a homogeneous stationary region, was significantly lower for k-t SPARSE-SENSE than for generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (0.05 ± 0.01 vs. 0.19 ± 0.06 radians, respectively; P {\textless} 0.01).

Different receiver coil systems (with one and eight channels), acquisitions with and without parallel imaging, and five different reconstruction filters were compared.ResultsAveraged over all phantom measurements, the deviations from the reference value provided by the multiple-acquisitions method are 2.7\% (SD 1.6\%) for the difference method, 37.7\% (25.9\%) for the evaluation of the mean value of background noise, and 34.0\% (38.1\%) for the evaluation of the SD of background noise.ConclusionThe conventionally determined SNR based on separate signal and noise regions in a single image will in general not agree with the true SNR measured in images after the application of certain reconstruction filters, multichannel reconstruction, or parallel imaging.

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining simultaneous measurements of longitudinal strain and transvalvular blood velocity during supine bicycle exercise stress in a wide bore magnetic resonance scanner. Combining information from the two datasets, we observe that although the time to peak strain (33.28 ± 1.86 versus 25.7 ± 2.12 as \% of R-R interval) and time to peak mitral inflow velocity (44.37 ± 5.21 versus 35.5 ± 4.19 as \% of R-R interval) from R-wave of the QRS complex occurred earlier during stress, the time from peak strain to peak mitral inflow velocity was not statistically different (16.5 ± 3.23 versus 13.4 ± 3.06). Further, the percentage of longitudinal relaxation at peak mitral inflow velocity was higher during stress (63.5 ± 7.72 versus 84.32 ± 6.24). These results suggest that although diastole is shortened, early diastolic filling efficiency is augmented during exercise stress in normal volunteers in an effort to maintain stroke volume.

	abstract = {We describe methods for simultaneously acquiring and subsequently combining data from a multitude of closely positioned NMR receiving coils. The approach is conceptually similar to phased array radar and ultrasound and hence we call our techniques the “NMR phased array.” The NMR phased array offers the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution of a small surface coil over fields-of-view (FOV) normally associated with body imaging with no increase in imaging time. The NMR phased array can be applied to both imaging and spectroscopy for all pulse sequences. The problematic interactions among nearby surface coils is eliminated (a) by overlapping adjacent coils to give zero mutual inductance, hence zero interaction, and (b) by attaching low input impedance preamplifiers to all coils, thus eliminating interference among next nearest and more distant neighbors. We derive an algorithm for combining the data from the phased array elements to yield an image with optimum SNR. Other techniques which are easier to implement at the cost of lower SNR are explored. Phased array imaging is demonstrated with high resolution (512 × 512, 48-cm FOV, and 32-cm FOV) spin-echo images of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Data were acquired from four-element linear spine arrays, the first made of 12-cm square coils and the second made of 8-cm square coils. When compared with images from a single 15 × 30-cm rectangular coil and identical imaging parameters, the phased array yields a 2X and 3X higher SNR at the depth of the spine ( ∼ 7 cm). © 1990 Academic Press, Inc.},

It involves acquiring real-time low-resolution images in specific orthogonal orientations, extracting coronary motion from these images, and then using this motion information to guide high-resolution MR image acquisition on a beat-to-beat basis. The present study establishes the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach using human motion data in an offline implementation, prior to future online implementation on an MRI scanner. To track the coronary arteries in low-resolution real-time MR images in an accurate manner, a tracking approach is presented and validated. The tracking algorithm was run on real-time images acquired at 15–20 frames per second in four-chamber, short-axis, and coronal views in five volunteers. The systolic and diastolic periods in the cardiac cycles, computed from the extracted motion information, had significant variability during the short time periods typical of cardiac MRI. It is also demonstrated through simulation analysis using human tracked coronary motion data that accounting for this cardiac variability by adaptively changing the trigger delay for acquisition on a beat-to-beat basis improves overall motion compensation and hence MR image quality evaluated in terms of SNR and CNR values.

A computer simulation of dynamic shimming using real image data has been developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of higher order dynamic shimming for echo planar imaging at high magnetic field, and to investigate the potential benefits of different orders of shim coil. Geometric distortions and signal intensities for different degrees of dynamic shimming were simulated and the results are compared with the images obtained with a conventional shimming technique.

	abstract = {Image processing was used as a fundamental tool to derive motion information from magnetic resonance (MR) images, which was fed back into prospective respiratory motion correction during subsequent data acquisition to improve image quality in coronary MR angiography (CMRA) scans. This reduces motion artifacts in the images and, in addition, enables the usage of a broader gating window than commonly used today to increase the scan efficiency. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to find a suitable motion model to be used for respiratory motion correction in cardiac imaging and to develop a calibration procedure to adapt the motion model to the individual patient. At first, the performance of three motion models [one-dimensional translation in feet-head (FH) direction, three-dimensional (3-D) translation, and 3-D affine transformation] was tested in a small volunteer study. An elastic image registration algorithm was applied to 3-D MR images of the coronary vessels obtained at different respiratory levels. A strong intersubject variability was observed. The 3-D translation and affine transformation model were found to be superior over the conventional FH translation model used today. Furthermore, a new approach is presented, which utilizes a fast model-based image registration to extract motion information from time series of low-resolution 3-D MR images, which reflects the respiratory motion of the heart. The registration is based on a selectable global 3-D motion model (translation, rigid, or affine transformation). All 3-D MR images were registered with respect to end expiration. The resulting time series of model parameters were analyzed in combination with additionally acquired motion information from a diaphragmatic MR pencil-beam navigator to calibrate the respiratory motion model. To demonstrate the potential of a calibrated motion model for prospective motion correction in coronary imaging, the approach was tested in CMRA examinations in five volunteers.},

PWTD is a novel ultrasound method to quantify myocardial contraction and relaxation velocities. In 27 young normal subjects, PWTD peak values of longitudinal systolic and diastolic velocities were measured for 12 left ventricular segments visualized from the apical window. The PWTD sampling of each myocardial segment resulted in a triphasic velocity curve during each cardiac cycle: a systolic velocity wave (S) directed toward the transducer, and an early diastolic (E) and a late diastolic (A) velocity wave away from the transducer. A heterogeneous pattern of systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities was observed between individual wall segments as well as for the basal and midsegments of each myocardial wall. The difference between the highest and lowest values for S was 38.4\% in the basal segments and 56.3\% in the midwall segments. The difference between low and high velocities for E was 61.4\% in the basal and 38.2\% in the midsegments; for A the difference was 29.5\% in the basal and 32.6\% in the midsegments. In general, lower velocity values were found in the septum with higher basal to midwall difference. The lateral and posterior walls had higher, but more uniform, velocities. PWTD enables the quantitative assessment of regional systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Substantial heterogeneity of velocities exists within individual myocardial segments, and must be taken into account in any clinical application. The observed heterogeneity in longitudinal function is consistent with the known spatial distribution of myocardial fibers.},

To compare longitudinal myocardial velocity and time to peak longitudinal velocity obtained with magnetic resonance phase velocity mapping (MR-PVM) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and to assess the reproducibility of each method.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Longitudinal myocardial velocity was measured by TDI and MR-PVM in 10 normal volunteers and 10 patients with dyssynchrony. The reproducibility of MR-PVM and TDI was assessed on repeated measurements in the 10 normal volunteers.


RESULTS

MR and TDI measurements of longitudinal myocardial velocity correlated well (r = 0.86) in both normal subjects and patients with dyssynchrony. However, myocardial velocities measured with MR consistently exceeded velocities measured with TDI. MR and TDI agreed strongly in measuring the time to peak velocity (r = 0.97). The reproducibility of TDI and MR-PVM appeared similar in measuring peak velocities (13.1\% vs. 11.0\%, respectively; P = NS) and time to peak velocity (9.1\% vs. 5.7\%, respectively; P = NS).


CONCLUSION

Excellent correlation and reproducibility were observed between MR-PVM and TDI in measuring longitudinal myocardial velocity and time to peak velocity in both normal subjects and patients with dyssynchrony.},

Simultaneous recordings were made of central aorta and left ventricular pressure, maximum rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dp/dt), external carotid pulse, external and internal sound, and electrocardiogram. Acute interventions were used to vary the indices by a variety of mechanisms including changes in contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate. The initial values and the changes in these values produced by acute interventions are identical for left ventricular ejection time (LVET) whether measured externally (range 175 to 385 msec) or internally (range 169 to 392), r = 0.99. Although the absolute values differed for internally measured isovolumic contraction time (internal ICT), externally measured ICT, and preejection time (PEP), there was good linear correlation between the changes observed in these values following the interventions. Changes in PEP and internal ICT showed excellent linear correlation (r = 0.94) and were also alike in absolute value following the interventions. The interval from the Q wave of the electrocardiogram to rise in left ventricular pressure (electrical-mechanical delay) did not change significantly during these interventions. During a period of spontaneous isorhythmic dissociation there was close tracking between beat-to-beat changes in PEP and internal ICT and between externally and internally measured LVET. Following acute interventions PEP and left ventricular dp/dt changed inversely.
Externally measured systolic time intervals have therefore been shown in man to correlate well with directly measured internal indices, both in steady-state conditions and during a series of acute interventions. This convenient and atraumatic method has been shown to be a valid and sensitive measure of myocardial performance.},

	abstract = {Conventionally, MR images are formed by applying gradients to the main static magnetic field (B0). However, the B0 gradient equipment is expensive, power-hungry, complex, and noisy and can induce eddy currents in nearby conducting structures, including the patient. Here, we describe a new silent, B0 gradient-free MRI principle, Transmit Array Spatial Encoding (TRASE), based on phase gradients of the radio-frequency (RF) field. RF phase gradients offer a new method of k-space traversal. Echo trains using at least two different RF phase gradients allow spin phase to accumulate, causing k-space traversal. Two such RF fields provide one-dimensional imaging and three are sufficient for two-dimensional imaging. Since TRASE is a k-space method, analogues of many conventional pulse sequences are possible. Experimental results demonstrate one-dimensional and two-dimensional RF MRI and slice selection using a single-channel, transmit/receive, 0.2 T, permanent magnet, human MR system. The experimentally demonstrated spatial resolution is much higher than that provided by RF receive coil array sensitivity encoding alone but lower than generally achievable with B0 gradients. Potential applications are those in which one or more of the features of simplified equipment, lower costs, silent MRI, or the different physics of the image formation process are particularly advantageous.

We examined 8 patients after acute myocardial wall infarction and 10 healthy volunteers for comparison. PC velocity mapping was performed in a single midventricular short-axis slice with velocity encoding in three different directions. RV displacement during systole in the through-plane direction differed significantly between patients and volunteers (P = 0.009). RV myocardial velocity in the through-plane and radial directions, evaluated at time of peak ejection rate, was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers (P{\textless}0.05). RV abnormalities may be detected in patients after acute myocardial infarction using PC velocity mapping with velocity encoding in three different directions. Owing to their short acquisition times and relatively easy postprocessing, PC techniques are time-efficient and promising tools for the evaluation of RV function.},

Flow determinations were obtained in a model of fluid movement approximating blood-flow conditions in the portal venous system. A suitable protocol was based on consideration of the theoretical effects of (1) spatial resolution, (2) obliquity of the imaging plane to the direction of flow, and (3) signal-to-noise ratio of the signed quantitative velocity images (in three volunteers) on the accuracy and precision of flow measurements. This protocol was used to obtain cine phase-contrast MR images of the portal venous system in five volunteers and six patients.
Values obtained with a flow phantom showed good accuracy of cine phase-contrast-measured vs actual volumetric flow rate (r = .995; p = .0001; MR rate = [0.94 x actual rate] + 65.6 ml/min; standard error of the y estimate = 67.3 ml/min). Velocity encoding and section thickness substantially influenced the signal-to-noise ratio of the velocity images, whereas flip angle and matrix size had only minimal effect. In volunteers and patients, portal volumetric flow rates determined by using MR images and Doppler sonography showed good correlation (r = .94; p = .0003).
Our results indicate that cine phase-contrast MR imaging is a practical noninvasive method for measuring volumetric flow rates in the portal venous system.},

PFR measurements made by means of PC MR techniques varied, depending on BH method, and were systematically less than those obtained by DDI. PFR measured during inspiration was significantly less than that measured during expiration and other respiratory maneuvers (P {\textless} .03). PFR increased significantly after a meal for PC and Doppler measurements, with a range of mean increases of 24 to 74\%. Two-dimensional PC MR imaging techniques yielded differing measurements of PFR, depending on whether they were done with or without BH, as well as on the pattern of BH.

To quantify the vertical (gravitationally dependent) gradient of SV in eight healthy supine subjects, we implemented a novel proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method. Oxygen is used as a contrast agent, which in solution changes the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) in lung tissue. Thus alterations in the MR signal resulting from the regional rise in O(2) concentration following a sudden change in inspired O(2) reflect SV-lung units with higher SV reach a new equilibrium faster than those with lower SV. We acquired T1-weighted inversion recovery images of a sagittal slice of the supine right lung with a 1.5-T MRI system. Images were voluntarily respiratory gated at functional residual capacity; 20 images were acquired with the subject breathing air and 20 breathing 100\% O(2), and this cycle was repeated five times. Expired tidal volume was measured simultaneously. The SV maps presented an average spatial fractal dimension of 1.13 ± 0.03. There was a vertical gradient in SV of 0.029 ± 0.012 cm(-1), with SV being highest in the dependent lung. Dividing the lung vertically into thirds showed a statistically significant difference in SV, with SV of 0.42 ± 0.14 (mean ± SD), 0.29 ± 0.10, and 0.24 ± 0.08 in the dependent, intermediate, and nondependent regions, respectively (all differences, P {\textless} 0.05). This vertical gradient in SV is consistent with the known gravitationally induced deformation of the lung resulting in greater lung expansion in the dependent lung with inspiration. This SV imaging technique can be used to quantify regional SV in the lung with proton MRI.},

	abstract = {OBJECT: We evaluated the use of kt-broad-use linear acquisition speed-up technique (kt-BLAST) acceleration of mouse cardiac imaging in order to reduce scan times, thereby minimising physiological variation and improving animal welfare.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional cine cardiac MRI data acquired from healthy mice (n = 9) were subsampled to simulate kt-BLAST acceleration. Cardiological indices (left ventricular volume, ejection fraction and mass) were determined as a function of acceleration factor. kt-BLAST threefold undersampling was implemented on the scanner and applied to a second group of mice (n = 6 healthy plus 6 with myocardial infarct), being compared with standard cine imaging (3 signal averages) and cine imaging with one signal average.
RESULTS: In the simulations, sufficient accuracy was achieved for undersampling factors up to three. Cardiological indices determined from the implemented kt-BLAST scanning showed no significant differences compared with the values determined from the standard sequence, and neither did indices derived from the cine scan with only one signal average despite its lower signal-to-noise ratio. Both techniques were applied successfully in the infarcted hearts.
CONCLUSION: For cardiac imaging of mice, threefold undersampling of kt-space, or a similar reduction in the number of signal averages, are both feasible with subsequent reduction in imaging time.},

	abstract = {Phase contrast techniques in combination with k-space segmented CINE imaging are widely used for the quantitative assessment of blood flow or tissue motion. The temporal resolution of the corresponding pulse sequences plays an important role concerning the potential of the method to fully detect time resolved flow or motion patterns. A further improvement of temporal or spatial resolution in phase contrast CINE MRI can be achieved by the application of view sharing. Based on simulations with point-spread-functions resulting from different cyclic flow or motion patterns an analysis of view sharing techniques in combination with phase contrast MRI is presented. Velocity mapping properties and the role of different k-space regions concerning the resulting values in the phase images and thus encoded velocities were investigated. It could be shown that the velocity induced phase shifts in phase contrast techniques are mainly encoded in the central sections of k-space which makes view sharing also suitable for velocity mapping. As a result the use of appropriate sampling and data acquisition schemes permits the assessment of flow or motion patterns with significantly improved temporal resolution without loss of functional information. In addition phantom measurements with an oscillation phantom were performed in order to validate the simulation results and to demonstrate the potential of view sharing techniques to accelerate phase contrast imaging and improve the detection of the underlying flow or motion dynamics.},

Materials and Methods: Ten rats were subjected to sham surgery (n=3) or transient ischemia for 45 minutes followed by reperfusion (n=7). A retrospectively gated cardiac MRI sequence, IntraGate FLASH (Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen), was used for cine MRI in short axis. Navigator echoes provided input signals for the motion corrected reconstruction.
Results: SNR was increased by a factor of 1.6 while left ventricular end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, ejection fraction were not significantly different. End-diastolic mass was significantly different and closer to the true mass.
Conclusion: Retrospectively gated cine MRI can benefit from motion correction to increase SNR. Because cardiac motion is compensated for in the reconstruction, the cardiac window used for reconstruction can be increased to include more data and this leads to increased SNR.},

The method enabled detection of contrast enhancement in atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch after I.V. injection of micelles and iron oxides resulting in reproducible plaque enhancement. Both contrast agents were taken up in the plaque, which was confirmed by histology. Additionally, the retrospective-gated CINE method provided images of the aortic wall throughout the cardiac cycle, from which the vessel wall distensibility could be calculated. Reduction in plaque size by statin treatment resulted in lower contrast enhancement and reduced wall stiffness.ConclusionsThe retrospective-gated CINE MRI provides a robust and simple way to detect and quantify contrast enhancement in atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic wall of ApoE−/− mice. From the same scan, plaque-related changes in stiffness of the aortic wall can be determined. In this mouse model, a correlation between vessel wall stiffness and atherosclerotic lesions was found.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To address degradation of coronary MR angiography (MRA) image quality due to heart rate variability (HRV)-associated variations in coronary artery position and motion.
Materials and Methods
Free-breathing navigator-gated and -corrected coronary MRA using subject-specific trigger delays and acquisition windows was combined with a real-time HRV correction algorithm, such as commonly used in left ventricular wall motion studies. Ten healthy adults underwent free-breathing navigator-gated and -corrected coronary MRA with and without HRV correction. Signal-to-noise (SNR), contrast-to-noise (CNR), vessel length, diameter, sharpness, and subjective image quality (on a five-point scale) were compared in a blinded fashion.
Results
Vessel sharpness improved significantly for both the left (LCA) and right (RCA) coronary artery systems (P = 0.016 and P = 0.015, respectively) with the use of HRV correction. Subjective image quality also improved significantly when HRV correction was used (P = 0.003). There were no significant differences with regard to SNR and CNR (P {\textgreater} 0.1).
Conclusions
Preliminary results suggest that HRV correction improves objective and subjective image quality in coronary MRA. Continued studies in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease are warranted to investigate the clinical impact of this technique. J. Magn. Reson.

	abstract = {Considerable strides have been made by countless individual researchers in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to push DWI from an experimental tool – limited to a few institutions with specialized instrumentation – to a powerful tool used routinely for diagnostic imaging. Despite its current success, the field of DWI constantly evolves and progress has been made on several fronts, awaiting adoption by vendors and clinical users to bring in the next generation of DWI. These developments are primarily comprised of improved robustness against patient and physiologic motion, increased spatial resolution, new biophysical and tissue models, and new clinical applications for DWI. This article aims to provide a succinct overview of some of these new developments and a description of some of the major challenges associated with DWI. Trying to understand some of these challenges is helpful not only to the technically savvy MRI user, but also to radiologists who are interested in the potential strengths and weaknesses of these techniques, what is in the “diffusion pipeline”, and in how to interpret artifacts on DWI scans.},

	abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for axon diameter mapping benefit from higher maximum gradient strengths than are currently available on commercial human scanners. Using a dedicated high-gradient 3 T human MRI scanner with a maximum gradient strength of 300 mT/m, we systematically studied the effect of gradient strength on in vivo axon diameter and density estimates in the human corpus callosum. Pulsed gradient spin echo experiments were performed in a single scan session lasting approximately 2 h on each of three human subjects. The data were then divided into subsets with maximum gradient strengths of 77, 145, 212, and 293 mT/m and diffusion times encompassing short (16 and 25 ms) and long (60 and 94 ms) diffusion time regimes. A three-compartment model of intra-axonal diffusion, extra-axonal diffusion, and free diffusion in cerebrospinal fluid was fitted to the data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. For the acquisition parameters, model, and fitting routine used in our study, it was found that higher maximum gradient strengths decreased the mean axon diameter estimates by two to three fold and decreased the uncertainty in axon diameter estimates by more than half across the corpus callosum. The exclusive use of longer diffusion times resulted in axon diameter estimates that were up to two times larger than those obtained with shorter diffusion times. Axon diameter and density maps appeared less noisy and showed improved contrast between different regions of the corpus callosum with higher maximum gradient strength. Known differences in axon diameter and density between the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum were preserved and became more reproducible at higher maximum gradient strengths. Our results suggest that an optimal q-space sampling scheme for estimating in vivo axon diameters should incorporate the highest possible gradient strength. The improvement in axon diameter and density estimates that we demonstrate from increasing maximum gradient strength will inform protocol development and encourage the adoption of higher maximum gradient strengths for use in commercial human scanners.},

Steady-state DWI is, however, best suited to a segmented three-dimensional acquisition and thus requires three-dimensional navigation to fully correct for motion artifacts. In this paper, a method for three-dimensional motion-corrected steady-state DWI is presented. The method uses a unique acquisition and reconstruction scheme named trajectory using radially batched internal navigator echoes (TURBINE). Steady-state DWI with TURBINE uses slab-selection and a short echo-planar imaging (EPI) readout each pulse repetition time. Successive EPI readouts are rotated about the phase-encode axis. For image reconstruction, batches of cardiac-synchronized readouts are used to form three-dimensional navigators from a fully sampled central k-space cylinder. In vivo steady-state DWI with TURBINE is demonstrated in human brain. Motion artifacts are corrected using refocusing reconstruction and TURBINE images prove less distorted compared to two-dimensional single-shot diffusion-weighted-spin-EPI.},

Regardless of the model or fitting function proposed for characterizing sufficiently sampled decay curves (vide infra), the departure from monoexponentiality spells increased tissue characterization potential. The degree to which this potential can be harnessed to improve specificity, sensitivity and spatial localization of diseases in brain, and other tissues, largely remains to be explored. Furthermore, the degree to which currently popular diffusion tensor imaging methods, including visually impressive white matter fiber "tractography" results, have almost completely ignored the nonmonoexponential nature of the basic signal decay with b factor is worthy of communal introspection. Here we limit our attention to a review of the basic experimental features associated with brain water signal diffusion decay curves as measured over extended b-factor ranges, the simple few parameter fitting functions that have been proposed to characterize these decays and the more involved models, e.g.,"ruminations," which have been proposed to account for the nonmonoexponentiality to date.},

The sequence employed simultaneous application of three orthogonal gradients to achieve an optimal signal attenuation for imaging the brain without any increase in echo time. The orientation of the effective diffusion-encoding gradient was off-axis. On the in vivo apparent diffusion coefficient maps of four healthy volunteers, white matter tracts (the internal capsule and the corpus callosum) and the cortical and deep white matter showed anisotropic diffusion. In the gray matter, such as basal ganglia and thalami, anisotropic diffusion was not observed. A typical whole-body imager can provide in vivo human brain diffusion images of clinical quality. This technique has promising implications for the evaluation of brain development and the diagnosis of degenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In human brain, the relationship between MR signal and b value is complicated by cerebral perfusion, restricted diffusion, anisotropy, cellular membrane permeability, and active cellular transport of water molecules. Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of the number and strength of diffusion-sensitizing gradients on measured isotropic apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCi), fractional anisotropy (FA), and their respective SD in different anatomic locations of the brain.
METHODS: Quantitative apparent diffusion coefficients and diffusion anisotropy brain maps were obtained from 10 healthy volunteers by using six different levels of diffusion weighting (b0 = 0, b1 = 160, b2 = 320, b3 = 480, b4 = 640, and b5 = 800 s/mm2), applied sequentially in six different directions (Gxx, Gyy, Gzz, Gxy, Gxz, Gyz) and coupled to a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar (2045/115 [TR/TE]) MR imaging technique. ADCi, FA, eigenvalues (λ1, λ2, λ3)1 of the principal eigenvectors, and their respective SD were measured from seven different anatomic locations in the brain. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate for the existence of significant differences in the average and SD of the calculated ADCi and FA as a function of the number and strength of b values. When a difference existed, the Bonferroni t method was used for paired comparisons of the groups.
RESULTS: The measured ADCi was affected by the number and strength of b values (P {\textless} .05). The SD of the ADCi was affected by the strength (P {\textless} .05) but not the number of b values (P {\textgreater} .05). The measured FA was unaffected by the number and strength of b values (P {\textgreater} .05). The SD was affected by the number and strength of b values (P {\textless} .05).
CONCLUSION: The number and strength of b values do influence measures of diffusion and anisotropy. Attention to the choice of diffusion sensitization parameters is important in decisions regarding clinical feasibility (acquisition time) and normative measures.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) is increasingly being introduced in the clinic, both for diagnostics and image guidance. Although dedicated 3D US probes exist, 3D US can also be acquired with the still frequently used two-dimensional (2D) US probes. Obtaining 3D volumes with 2D US probes is a two-step process. First, a positioning sensor must be attached to the probe; second, a reconstruction of a 3D volume can be performed into a regular voxel grid. Various algorithms have been used for performing 3D reconstruction based on 2D images. Up till now, a complete overview of the algorithms, the way they work and their benefits and drawbacks due to various applications has been missing. The lack of an overview is made clear by confusions about algorithm and group names in the existing literature. This article is a review aimed at explaining and categorizing the various algorithms into groups, according to algorithm implementation. The algorithms are compared based on published data and our own laboratory results. Positive and practical uses of the various algorithms for different applications are discussed, with a focus on image guidance. (E-mail: ole.v.solberg@sintef.no)},

Both applications rely heavily on the consistent, accurate calibration of imaging gradients, yet such calibrations are typically only performed during maintenance sessions by equipment manufacturers, and potentially with acceptance limits that are inadequate for phenotyping. To overcome this difficulty, we present a protocol for gradient calibration quality assurance testing, based on a 3D-printed, open source, structural phantom that can be customised to the dimensions of individual scanners and RF coils. In trials on a 9.4 T system, the gradient scaling errors were reduced by an order of magnitude, and displacements of greater than 100 µm, caused by gradient non-linearity, were corrected using a post-processing technique. The step-by-step protocol can be integrated into routine pre-clinical MRI quality assurance to measure and correct for these errors. We suggest that this type of quality assurance is essential for robust pre-clinical MRI experiments that rely on accurate imaging gradients, including small animal phenotyping and diffusion MR.},

However, at the same time, more new complexities and challenges are brought to the conventional SAR imaging algorithms. The back-projection algorithm and range migration algorithm are two newly developed algorithms that can be used in ultra-wideband SAR imaging. The back-projection algorithm originates from the medical imaging reconstruction technique called computer-aided tomography whereas the range migration algorithm is derived from seismic migration techniques. In the application to SAR imaging, the performance comparison is made in this paper based on theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental data. The analysis and processing results show that both algorithms are suitable for ultra-wideband SAR imaging and the theoretical resolution performances can be achieved. In addition, some practical issues of implementation and performance difference about these two algorithms are addressed as well},

	abstract = {Purpose

The balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) pulse sequence has shown to be of great interest due to its high signal-to-noise ratio efficiency. However, bSSFP images often suffer from banding artifacts due to off-resonance effects, which we aim to minimize in this article.


Methods

We present a general and fast two-step algorithm for 1) estimating the unknowns in the bSSFP signal model from multiple phase-cycled acquisitions, and 2) reconstructing band-free images. The first step, linearization for off-resonance estimation (LORE), solves the nonlinear problem approximately by a robust linear approach. The second step applies a Gauss-Newton algorithm, initialized by LORE, to minimize the nonlinear least squares criterion. We name the full algorithm LORE-GN.


Results

We derive the Cramér-Rao bound, a theoretical lower bound of the variance for any unbiased estimator, and show that LORE-GN is statistically efficient. Furthermore, we show that simultaneous estimation of T1 and T2 from phase-cycled bSSFP is difficult, since the Cramér-Rao bound is high at common signal-to-noise ratio. Using simulated, phantom, and in vivo data, we illustrate the band-reduction capabilities of LORE-GN compared to other techniques, such as sum-of-squares.


Conclusion

Using LORE-GN we can successfully minimize banding artifacts in bSSFP. Magn Reson Med 72:880–892, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Refocused steady-state free precession (SSFP) imaging sequences have recently regained popularity as faster gradient hardware has allowed shorter repetition times, thereby reducing SSFP's sensitivity to off-resonance effects. Although these sequences offer fast scanning with good signal-to-noise efficiency, the “transient response,” or time taken to reach a steady-state, can be long compared with the total imaging time, particularly when using 2D sequences. This results in lost imaging time and has made SSFP difficult to use for real-time and cardiac-gated applications. A linear-systems analysis of the steady-state and transient response for general periodic sequences is shown. The analysis is applied to refocused-SSFP sequences to generate a two-stage method of “catalyzing,” or speeding up the progression to steady-state by first scaling, then directing the magnetization. This catalyzing method is compared with previous methods in simulations and experimentally. Although the second stage of the method exhibits some sensitivity to B1 variations, our results show that the transient time can be significantly reduced, allowing imaging in a shorter total scan time.

	abstract = {Alternating TR steady-state free precession (ATR SSFP) has been proposed as a method to achieve a favorable frequency response compared to that of conventional balanced SSFP. ATR SSFP, much like conventional SSFP, exhibits oscillatory transient signal behavior that can degrade image quality. Thus an efficient preparation scheme is desired in order to actively reduce this initial signal fluctuation. Using an approach similar to that of Le Roux [Simplified model and stabilization of SSFP sequences, J. Magn. Resonan. 163 (1) (2003) 23–37], we construct a mathematical model for ATR SSFP sequences and show a Fourier relation between the separated odd and even terms of the RF flip angle increment sequence during an initial preparation, and the resulting oscillatory residues. A weighted Kaiser–Bessel windowed ramp can be used to design preparation schemes for arbitrary TR1, TR2, and RF phase cycling combinations. Optimized Kaiser–Bessel windowed ramp preparations for wideband SSFP and fat-suppressed ATR SSFP imaging are tested in phantoms. The results show substantially reduced transient signal oscillation with this new initial preparation method.},

	abstract = {Proper suppression of tissue clutter is a prerequisite for visualizing flow accurately in ultrasound color flow imaging. Among various clutter suppression methods, the eigen-based filter has shown potential because it can theoretically adapt its stopband to the actual clutter characteristics even when tissue motion is present. This paper presents a formative review on how eigen-based filters should be designed to improve their practical efficacy in adaptively suppressing clutter without affecting the blood flow echoes. Our review is centered around a comparative assessment of two eigen-filter design considerations: 1) eigen-component estimation approach (single-ensemble vs. multi-ensemble formulations), and 2) filter order selection mechanism (eigenvalue-based vs. frequencybased algorithms). To evaluate the practical efficacy of existing eigen-filter designs, we analyzed their clutter suppression level in two in vivo scenarios with substantial tissue motion (intra-operative coronary imaging and thyroid imaging). Our analysis shows that, as compared with polynomial regression filters (with or without instantaneous clutter downmixing), eigen-filters that use a frequency-based algorithm for filter order selection generally give Doppler power images with better contrast between blood and tissue regions. Results also suggest that both multi-ensemble and single-ensemble eigen-estimation approaches have their own advantages and weaknesses in different imaging scenarios. It may be beneficial to develop an algorithmic way of defining the eigen-filter formulation so that its performance advantages can be better realized.},

	abstract = {In chapters culled from the popular and critically acclaimed Electromagnetic Compatibility Handbook, Transmission Lines, Matching, and Crosstalk provides a tightly focused, convenient, and affordable reference for those interested primarily in this subset of topics. Author Kenneth L. Kaiser demystifies transmission lines, matching, and crosstalk and explains the source and limitations of the approximations, guidelines, models, and rules-of-thumb used in this field. The material is presented in a unique question-and-answer format that gets straight to the heart of each topic. The book includes numerous examples and uses Mathcad to generate all of the figures and many solutions to equations. In many cases, the entire Mathcad program is provided.},

	abstract = {Each generation of total shoulder arthroplasy has improved on the previous. The newest humeral component innovation is shortening the humeral component or eliminating the stem entirely to rely on stemless fixation in the humeral metaphysis. This offers theoretical advantages of preserved bone stock, less stress shielding, eliminating the diaphyseal stress riser, ease of stem removal at revision, and humeral head placement independent from the humeral shaft axis. There are a number of short term cohorts that have shown low complication rates and outcomes similar to previous generations of stemmed humeral components. Longer term and better designed studies are needed in order for short stems and stemless components to become the standard of care.},

	abstract = {Purpose

The measurement of the transfer function is a good tool to evaluate the radiofrequency heating of complex conductive wires, such as pacemaker leads. The aim is to describe precisely the design of a transfer function bench and compare the measurements to simulations.


Methods

The transfer function was measured by mean of an excitation probe and a receiving probe, both connected to a two-port vector network analyzer. The experimental results were compared with the simulated results, reproducing the excitation scheme. This procedure was applied to two different cables with different geometrical and insulation properties to test the robustness of the setup.


Results

It is possible to touch the cable electrode with the excitation probe without inducing an error in the measured transfer function, which solves the direct coupling problem. There is a good agreement between the measured and simulated transfer function for both tested cables.


Conclusions

A valid transfer function measurement bench is described. Magn Reson Med, 2017. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.},

	abstract = {Use of both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pacing devices has undergone remarkable growth in recent years, and it is estimated that the majority of patients with pacemakers will need an MRI during their lifetime. These investigations will generally be denied due to the potentially dangerous interactions between cardiac devices and the magnetic fields and radio frequency energy used in MRI. Despite the increasing reports of uneventful scanning in selected patients with conventional pacemakers under close surveillance, MRI is still contraindicated in those circumstances and cannot be considered a routine procedure. These limitations prompted a series of modifications in generator and lead engineering, designed to minimize interactions that could compromise device function and patient safety. The resulting MRI-conditional pacemakers were first introduced in 2008 and the clinical experience gathered so far supports their safety in the MRI environment if certain conditions are fulfilled. With this technology, new questions and controversies arise regarding patient selection, clinical impact, and cost-effectiveness. In this review, we discuss the potential risks of MRI in patients with electronic cardiac devices and present updated information regarding the features of MRI-conditional pacemakers and the clinical experience with currently available models. Finally, we provide some guidance on how to scan patients who have these devices and discuss future directions in the field.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in specific absorption rate (SAR) in human-head tissues while using nonmagnetic metallic electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes and leads during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A realistic, high resolution (1 mm3) head model from individual MRI data was adopted to describe accurately thin tissues, such as bone marrow and skin. The RF power dissipated in the human head was evaluated using the FDTD algorithm. Both surface and bird cage coils were used. The following numbers of EEG electrodes/leads were considered: 16, 31, 62, and 124. Simulations were performed at 128 and 300 MHz. The difference in SAR between the electrodes/leads and no-electrodes conditions was greater with the bird cage coil than with the surface coil. The peak 1 g averaged SAR values were highest at 124 electrodes, increasing to as much as two orders of magnitude (×172.3) at 300 MHz compared to the original value. At 300 MHz, there was a fourfold (×3.6) increase of SAR averaged over the bone marrow, and a sevenfold (×7.4) increase in the skin. At 128 MHz, there was a fivefold (×5.6) increase of whole head SAR.

	abstract = {Purpose:

Metallic implants may cause serious tissue heating during magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. This heating occurs due to the induced currents caused by the radio-frequency (RF) field. Much work has been done to date to understand the relationship between the RF field and the induced currents. Most of these studies, however, were based purely on experimental or numerical methods. This study has three main purposes: (1) to define the RF heating properties of an implant lead using two parameters; (2) to develop an analytical formulation that directly explains the relationship between RF fields and induced currents; and (3) to form a basis for analysis of complex cases.


Methods:

In this study, a lumped element model of the transmission line was modified to model leads of implants inside the body. Using this model, leads are defined using two parameters: impedance per unit length,Z, and effective wavenumber along the lead, kt. These two parameters were obtained by using methods that are similar to the transmission line theory. As long as these parameters are known for a lead, currents induced in the lead can be obtained no matter how complex the lead geometry is. The currents induced in bare wire, lossy wire, and insulated wire were calculated using this new method which is called the modified transmission line method or MoTLiM. First, the calculated induced currents under uniform electric field distribution were solved and compared with method-of-moments (MoM) calculations. In addition, MoTLiM results were compared with those of phantom experiments. For experimental verification, the flip angle distortion due to the induced currents was used. The flip angle distribution around a wire was both measured by using flip angle imaging methods and calculated using current distribution obtained from the MoTLiM. Finally, these results were compared and an error analysis was carried out.


Results:

Bare perfect electric, bare lossy, and insulated perfect electric conductor wires under uniform and linearly varying electric field exposure were solved, both for 1.5 T and 3 T scanners, using both the MoTLiM and MoM. The results are in agreement within 10\% mean-square error. The flip angle distribution that was obtained from experiments was compared along the azimuthal paths with different distances from the wire. The highest mean-square error was 20\% among compared cases.


Conclusions:

A novel method was developed to define the RF heating properties of implant leads with two parameters and analyze the induced currents on implant leads that are exposed to electromagnetic fields in a lossy medium during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Some simple cases are examined to explain the MoTLiM and a basis is formed for the analysis of complex cases. The method presented shows the direct relationship between the incident RF field and the induced currents. In addition, the MoTLiM reveals the RF heating properties of the implant leads in terms of the physical features of the lead and electrical properties of the medium.},

	abstract = {Purpose

To assess the risk of radiofrequency (RF) -induced heating in patients with MR-conditional pacemaker (PM) systems, in the presence of another lead abandoned from a previous implant.


Methods

Four commercial pacemaker leads were placed beside a MR-conditional PM system, inside a human trunk simulator. The phantom has been exposed to the RF generated by a 64 MHz body bird-cage coil (whole-body specific absorption rate [SAR] = 1 W/kg) and the induced heating was measured at the tip of the abandoned lead and of the MR-conditional implant. Configurations that maximize the coupling between the RF field and the leads have been tested, as well as realistic implant positions.


Results

Abandoned leads showed heating behaviors that strongly depend on the termination condition (abandoned-capped or saline exposed) and on the lead path (left or right positioning). Given a whole-body SAR = 1 W/kg, a maximum temperature rise of 17.6°C was observed. The presence of the abandoned lead modifies the RF-heating profile of the MR-conditional implant: either an increase or a decrease in the induced heating at its lead tip can occur, mainly depending on the relative position of the two leads. Variations ranging from −63\% to +69\% with respect to the MR-conditional system alone were observed.


Conclusion

These findings provide experimental evidence that the presence of an abandoned lead poses an additional risk for the patient implanted with a MR-conditional PM system. Our results support the current PM manufacturers' policy of conditioning the MR compatibility of their systems to the absence of abandoned leads (including leads from MR-conditional implants). From a clinical point of view, in such cases, the decision whether to perform the exam shall be based upon a risk/benefit evaluation, as in the case of conventional PM systems.

Most of the time, Feinstein’s model is used to project multiple cardiac cycles of variable lengths into a mean cycle.   Objective To assess the effect of Feinstein projection on temporal resolution of Cine-MRI.   Methods 1/The temporal errors during Feinstein’s projection were computed in 306 cardiac cycles fully characterized by tissue Doppler imaging with 6-phase analysis (from a population of 7 children and young adults). 2/The effects of these temporal errors on tissue velocities were assessed by simulating typical tissue phase mapping acquisitions and reconstructions. 3/Myocardial velocities curves, extracted from high-resolution phase-contrast cine images, were compared for the 6 volunteers with lowest and highest heart rate variability, within a population of 36 young adults.   Results 1/The mean of temporal misalignments was 30 ms over the cardiac cycle but reached 60 ms during early diastole. 2/During phase contrast MRI simulation, early diastole velocity peaks were diminished by 6.1 cm/s leading to virtual disappearance of isovolumic relaxation peaks. 3/The smoothing and erasing of isovolumic relaxation peaks was confirmed on tissue phase mapping velocity curves, between subjects with low and high heart rate variability (p = 0.05).   Conclusions Feinstein cardiac model creates temporal misalignments that impair high temporal resolution phase contrast cine imaging when beat-to-beat heart rate is changing.},

	abstract = {Background Prediction of End-Systole time is of utmost importance for cardiac MRI to correctly associate acquired k-space lines during reconstruction of cine acquisitions. This prediction is usually based on the patient’s heart rate using Weissler’s formula, which was calibrated by linear regression within a population and cannot account for individual variability.   Objective We propose an automatic method to build a personalized model that better predicts end-systole.   Methods A phase contrast sequence was modified to acquire only central k-space line with 6.6ms temporal resolution, in a slice passing through the aorta during 128 heartbeats in 35 subjects. Segmentation of aorta and detection of end of systolic ejection was automatic. Duration of electromechanical systole duration as function of heart rate was determined for each subject separately.   Results In comparison with the global models, the adapted cardiac model predicted significantly better both echocardiographic end-systolic reference (bias = 0ms vs 17ms, p{\textless}0.001) and MRI measurements (bias = 6.8ms vs 17ms). Favorable impact was shown on the cine reconstruction of the 5 subjects with the higher cardiac variability (p = 0.02).   Conclusions Personalization of cardiac model to the subject is feasible in MRI and reduces the error of prediction of systole.},
